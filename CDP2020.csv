At the end of 2009, hybrid vehicles still comprised 30% of our fleet. In Europe, almost all of our fleet is powered by fuel-efficient, smaller output diesel engines. We also have four vehicles that are using biodiesel, an alternative fuel to traditional gasoline or diesel, and one that is using compressed natural gas (CNG)."
Nordea Bank,Sweden,Public,Nordic 200,Global 500; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"Our worldwide greenhouse gas and energy reduction plan emphasizes proactive steps such as energy efficiency measures, process engineering improvements, green building design, fuel efficiency, and on-site generation, as well as the purchase of renewable energy. While our local power providers do not always include renewable energy in their mix of delivery, we are able to purchase Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) as a method to support development of wind energy, which is one element of our overall climate change strategy.  In 2009, we purchased Green-e certified RECs worth approximately 13,476 MWh (equal to 48,500 gigajoules) from the Tatanka Wind Farm in North and South Dakota. This offsets 100% of the electricity used by four of our U.S. manufacturing facilities and our Corporate Headquarters, or 14% of our total electricity use worldwide."
Nordea Bank,Sweden,Public,Nordic 200,Global 500; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"Some process emissions from our manufacturing activities pose a particular challenge for us due to their greater global warming potential. Between 2008 and 2009, we experienced a 15% increase in some of these emissions as a result of increased demand for our products used to produce vaccine and cancer treatments. No suitable substitute has yet been found for these gases, which are essential in product safety testing. While we were disappointed by the 2009 process emissions, we welcome the opportunity for improvement. We are currently working on an alternative process for testing our products, but we must ensure that any change results in products of equal or better quality and safety. We have already optimized our manufacturing process to reduce use of these gases, and in the short-term, are looking at methods to offset the emissions we cannot abate. Over the long term, we are working on an engineering solution we hope will eliminate our use of these gases altogether. And, we continue to seek opportunities to eliminate or reduce GHG emissions at our major manufacturing facilities. We remain committed to meeting our 20% GHG reduction target even as our business continues to grow."

Co.,Japan,Public,Japan 500,FTSE All-World 800,Long,"TransCanada’s ongoing commitment to improvements in energy and system efficiencies is demonstrated by our partnership with Rolls Royce to conduct turbine performance trials at the Nordegg Compressor Station. These trials indicate that the RB 211-6761 turbine can deliver up to a nine per cent reduction in fuel consumption and GHG emissions compared with earlier models. Previous generation turbines delivered thermal efficiencies of 35 per cent while the unit at Nordegg achieves 39 per cent efficiency and slightly better than 95 per cent operational availability. As the search for new natural gas resources reaches into the remote frontiers, pipelines span greater distances. Operational efficiency becomes essential in holding down energy costs and limiting greenhouse gas emissions produced by the transmission facilities."

The company has used the ODM to determine when blowdowns are necessary and to combine multiple repair projects into a single blowdown wherever feasible in Canada. In these situations, TransCanada routinely uses truck-mounted portable compressors to transfer gas from affected pipeline sections to adjoining or parallel pipeline sections, greatly reducing the amount of methane releases to the atmosphere."

One such program is the ongoing testing of the supersonic ejector which captures methane emission from dry gas seals. As a result of previous testing, TransCanada patented this technology. Captured methane is added to the fuel gas required to drive the turbines. This process builds on early dry gas seal technology pioneered by TransCanada that improved the efficiency of the seal, reducing fugitive emissions, as well as eliminating oil and grease spills. An agreement has been reached with a major compressor manufacturer to commercialize and market this technology, and a new prototype is being tested to ensure safe and reliable operation."

Faced with this realization, Cliffs and MPCA representatives partnered to find a way to redesign the facility in Forbes, Minnesota, that would provide greater emission reductions."
Telecom Italia,Italy,Public,Italy 60,Bonds 180; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800; Global 500,Long,"Cliffs committed to make substantial capital improvements to the facility, including a retrofit to allow burning of lower-emitting fuels and the addition of new emission control equipment. The project will allow enhanced fuel blending and the use of lower-sulfur coal and biomass, resulting in substantially less use of petroleum coke and natural gas. The estimated environmental improvements from the Green Production Project are substantial: for each ton of iron pellets produced, there could be a 14% reduction in mercury emissions, 30% reduction in GHG emissions and 37% reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. These reductions will allow the facility to increase production from approximately 5.3 million tons to 6 million tons per year, adding 24 new jobs, while still reducing annual air emissions and helping MPCA address the state’s regional haze issue."
Telecom Italia,Italy,Public,Italy 60,Bonds 180; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800; Global 500,Long,"Cliffs’ North American underground coal mining facilities in West Virginia and Alabama have been recovering coal mine methane for several years. As a voluntary participant on the Chicago Climate Exchange, Cliffs’ coal facilities have captured over 3.5 million cubic feet of coal mine methane as qualified early emission reductions from 2003 to 2006 (and substantially more prior to the qualifying period from 1999 to 2003). With extremely efficient surface-drilled multilateral wells, up to 90% of coal mine methane can be recovered and sold – substantially reducing the amount of methane subsequently released during mining and conserving a local source of valuable, clean-burning energy."
Telecom Italia,Italy,Public,Italy 60,Bonds 180; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800; Global 500,Long,"Mercury emissions also result from iron ore processing. Cliffs’ Minnesota operations have joined in a cooperative state-federal-industry research project to investigate possible means of reducing furnace emissions to address national and state concerns about mercury emissions from combustion sources. As part of this project, Cliffs and the other taconite mining companies in Minnesota have agreed to a voluntary 75% reduction by 2050 industry-wide, based on the 2010 Minnesota Mercury Emission Inventory taconite emission level of 841 pounds per year. If successful, this would result in a total reduction of 631 pounds per year (due to the variability of the quantity of mercury contained in each ore body, we currently cannot accurately measure the quantity of mercury emitted and must rely on estimations)."
Telecom Italia,Italy,Public,Italy 60,Bonds 180; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800; Global 500,Long,"The most significant emissions at Cliffs’ facilities contributing to regional haze are nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from process emissions and fugitive dust. As discussed in prior sections, Cliffs is actively pursuing ways to reduce process emissions –"
"Waste Management, Inc.",USA,Public,S&P 500,Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"With respect to fugitive emissions, dust from stockpiling and moving material can impact air quality and visibility. Each of our operations has comprehensive measures in place to control fugitive dust. These include daily inspections of fugitive emission sources, use of watering or foam dust control systems and other practices to minimize dust emissions. We have implemented specific practice and control measures for drilling, blasting, loading/unloading materials, unpaved roads, stockpiles, material transfer points, tailings basins and cleaning activities. When attention is required, corrective actions may include application of water or dust suppressants to roadways, mulching on basin beaches, addition of water to belt transfers or even reduction of material throughput."

Areva CI,France,Public,France 250,,Long,"Bunzl plc has worked with other residents of York House to cut the carbon emissions.  In the first nine months of 2009, emissions were cut by over 190 tonnes.  The York House Environmental Working Group of which Bunzl is a part agreed to install a new weather compensation system, preventing activation of boilers when external temperatures are above 15ºC.  This contributed to a reduction in gas use to 2 kWh this summer, from 122,054 kWh last summer, as well as a 22% cut in electricity consumption over the same period.  In addition the passive infrared sensors have been adjusted to switch the lights off within 20 minutes after motion detection."

"Limited Brands, Inc.",USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"• Supplier projects: Since spring 2009, as a result of the climate analyses, ICA has been involved in a project with five selected suppliers of ICA I love eco products to reduce the climate impact of their products and evaluate possible future requirements. Moreover, the project has facilitated a valuable transfer of experience between suppliers and with ICA and KRAV. As of 2010, all suppliers use green electricity in their production and all of them have or will conduct an energy analysis and set goals to reduce energy consumption. These companies have become increasingly aware of environmental issues, including climate change, which is leading to a steady flow of new ideas for improvements. The basis of this project is the knowledge gained through the climate analyses of private label products in 2007."
"Limited Brands, Inc.",USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"• Climate smart packaging - in 2008, ICA introduced packaging for its organic fruit and vegetables where petroleum-based plastics have been replaced by starch-based alternatives. They are biodegradable and meet the EU’s composting requirements."
Textron Inc.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"• Energy campaigns for frequent customers: ICA in Sweden ran a campaign in 2009, as it has done for many years, to offer regular customers better prices on energy-saving light bulbs. The bulbs that where sold are estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by around 18,300 tonnes based on the average mix of Sweden’s energy sources."

Cameron's Coffee,USA,Public,Walmart,,Long,"A target to reduce absolute electricity consumption by 11% by 2012 from a 2008 baseline has been set but we should achieve this saving by mid 2010. Primary focus is on reducing lighting and air-conditioning, as these generally consume the most electricity in commercial buildings. An energy strategy has been implemented. Key aspects of the strategy are: The baseline to measure electricity consumption against, an electricity target of 11% absolute reduction per building by 2012 is being targeted, an energy dashboard for large buildings, companies & business units is updated on a monthly basis to show business units how they are progressing towards the 11% reduction target, an energy forum assembles on a quarterly basis to collaborate energy saving initiatives using best practice. Initiatives  implemented include: Replacing magnetic ballasts with electronic ballasts in fluorescent lights, adjusting air conditioning settings slightly higher to reduce demand on the air-conditioner, replacing older air-conditioners and chillers with more energy efficient ones, window film or louvers on windows reduce heat entering a building, electricity optimisation products for air-conditioning reduce electricity demand, installing energy efficient lighting, installing sensors that switch off lights where there is no activity, setting the Building Management System to switch off lighting after hours. Results were that the total number of bulbs replaced with energy efficient bulbs - 26 159 and number of motion sensors installed - 2 342. This excludes the 130 branches that have replaced their bulbs and electronic control gear. There were also two DSM Lighting Retrofits projects implemented at: Bank City involving 18 200 bulbs replaced, and Selby where 5 662 bulbs were replaced. The total bulbs replaced with energy efficient bulbs in FirstRand is over 50 000. We have activated the energy saving (sleep mode) settings and schedule the shutting down of computers after hours, put timers on geysers. 14 transformers steps were adjusted to reduce this voltage by one step. This led to almost 5% electricity saving of more than R 70 000 pm. Roots Magazine (28 000 unit monthly staff magazine) contained a detailed article titled ‘Surviving the Power Crisis 101’ and a competition on what staff were doing to conserve energy at home was conducted."

They are installing skylights in all new stores to reduce the need for artificial light and increasing roofing and wall insulation. They are also installing energy efficient Low-E windows, which keep heat out of the store and reduce the demand on air conditioning units in the store."
Samsung Heavy Industries,South Korea,Public,Korea 200,Emerging Markets 800,Long,"In existing stores, Giant-Carlisle is replacing traditional lamps with LED bulbs. This has reduced energy usage by 50 percent in spotlight fixtures and 65 percent in glass door cases. The company also has an ongoing lighting kilowatt reduction program to remove or replace certain light fixtures in selected stores."
Samsung Heavy Industries,South Korea,Public,Korea 200,Emerging Markets 800,Long,"Giant-Carlisle has also installed glass doors on its dairy milk cases. Many of our companies are taking steps to cover refrigeration units, to reduce the energy used by the refrigeration system and allow for smaller cooling systems. In 2009, Giant-Carlisle installed its first refrigeration system using the more environmentally friendly refrigerant glycol and will install more of these systems in 2010."
Samsung Heavy Industries,South Korea,Public,Korea 200,Emerging Markets 800,Long,"Stop & Shop and Giant-Landover are also working to make their stores more energy efficient. They have installed energy efficient motors in their heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and refrigeration evaporators of walk-in cooler and freezer units. They are also improving the efficiency of refrigerated display cases and replacing open frozen food cases with closed-door ones. The businesses are also replacing existing store lighting and some frozen foods display cases with new T5 fluorescent and LED fixtures."
Samsung Heavy Industries,South Korea,Public,Korea 200,Emerging Markets 800,Long,"Stop & Shop has also been replacing ozone-depleting CFC refrigerants (R12, R502) and HCFC refrigerants (R22) from the refrigeration systems in its existing stores for the past five years. The replacement refrigerant for most of these systems has been HFC-404A, but in 2009, Stop & Shop began using HFC-407A. This new type of refrigerant is more environmentally friendly and has a lower global warming potential than HFC-404A."
Samsung Heavy Industries,South Korea,Public,Korea 200,Emerging Markets 800,Long,"In 2009, Stop & Shop and Giant-Landover completed 845 energy efficiency measures that have reduced the electricity consumption in their stores by 51 million kilowatt-hours."
Samsung Heavy Industries,South Korea,Public,Korea 200,Emerging Markets 800,Long,"Albert Heijn is also investing heavily in its climate action initiatives. The company is continuing to test new technologies and alternative energy generation systems. They have launched a program to add doors to coolers and to cover refrigerators and freezers, which will be completed before January 2015. Over 200 stores will have doors added to their refrigerators and covers to their freezers by mid-2010. Some stores are also using the heat from refrigerators to heat the store. Albert Heijn is installing more efficient LED lighting in its freezers and adding motion sensors to lights in storage rooms so that they only come on when needed. All new stores are equipped with state-of-the-art energy saving techniques."

In Sweden, ICA offers all its retailers the option to purchase renewable electricity. Forty percent of the stores are already using renewable electricity and many more are positive about the initiative. If ICA retailers are successful, ICA can reduce its CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2010 and meet the climate target ten years earlier than expected."
Tower Australia Group Ltd,Australia,Public,Australia 200,,Long,"In Sweden, Norway and the Baltics, ICA is covering or placing air curtains on freezers and refrigerated cases. Maxi ICA Östersund’s store now has doors on the majority of its refrigerated display cabinets, uses 100 percent natural refrigerants and reuses heat from the refrigeration system to heat the store. These measures account for energy savings of more than 35 percent, the equivalent of a reduction of more than 130 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year."
Tower Australia Group Ltd,Australia,Public,Australia 200,,Long,"In Norway, an increasing number of ICA stores are using the Cool ICA system, which monitors energy consumption.

Both Giant-Landover and Stop & Shop continue to reduce the number of truckloads used to deliver goods to our store. In 2009, we saved a total of 3,490 truckloads and 507,000 miles (816,000 km) by streamlining routing techniques and improving distribution center loading practices."
UBI Banca,Italy,Public,Italy 60,,Long,"Giant-Landover and Stop & Shop have made it a priority to select inbound freight carriers who are members of the EPA SmartWay program. It is as important to reduce fuel consumption for inbound trucks as it is for those making outbound deliveries. The EPA SmartWay program is a U.S. government initiative to reduce transportation-related emissions. Within the company, Stop & Shop and Giant-Landover have improved fuel economy through improved truck design and operational procedures such as controlling maximum speed limits."
UBI Banca,Italy,Public,Italy 60,,Long,"Giant-Carlisle also uses the latest technology in its truck fleet to achieve the best possible fuel economy. This includes truck design enhancements such as aerodynamic roof air shields, cab fairings, and front air dams to reduce air resistance. Drivers use onboard computers to monitor driver and truck fuel economy and to control idle time, speed, and cruise control. The computers also have software for optimal route planning to reduce total mileage. Sleeper trucks use auxiliary cabin heaters that allow the sleeping area to be heated while the engine is off. Automatic transmissions are used to progressively shift transmissions when accelerating and drivers are trained in fuel-efficient driving techniques. Combined, these measures made it possible for the Giant-Carlisle’s trucks to improve their fuel efficiency from 6.5 liters to 5.7 liters per thousand products sold."
UBI Banca,Italy,Public,Italy 60,,Long,"In 2009, Albert Heijn finished converting 90 percent of its fleet to whisper trucks and is on track to complete the remainder in 2010. Whisper trucks are virtually silent and therefore enable the company to make deliveries at night and in the early morning to avoid peak hour traffic and reduce the time and energy spent on the road. The company also converted 90 percent of its fleet to more efficient Euro 5 or EEV engines and will convert the remainder in 2010. Albert Heijn uses different sized trucks to transport products to the stores and distribution centers in the most efficient manner."

The transition to natural gas allows the Company to stop most of its use of fuel oil and diesel fuel at ICL's facilities, thus enabling the reduction of associated emissions. As a result of this step, a 25% reduction of particles emission is expected as well as a reduction of 65% - 75% in the emission of sulfuric acid. The transition to natural gas is also expected to reduce the emission of CO2, leading to a major improvement in ICL's carbon footprint."

Since the end of November 2007, an innovative system has been deployed to reduce the nitrous oxide emissions by about 80%. At this stage, the actual reduction achieved has reached 60%, and the Company is continuing its efforts to improve the performance of the system by supporting the developer of the technology, Johnson Matthey. The reduction achieved to date is equivalent to the prevention of emission of approximately 80,000 tons of carbon dioxide. The project was approved by the Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (CDMEB - UNFCC) with the backing of Israel’s National Committee for Clean Development.

Different gases can be used in this process, some of which have health and environmental effects. The gas used successfully by the magnesium industry around the world is known as SF6.

This metrics-based approach helped us understand ways we could manage the carbon intensity of our client portfolios, while remaining in alignment with utility clients that are focused on reducing their own environmental impacts. The bank has achieved this goal, which is further detailed in our most recent GRI report. This progress is attributable to two primary factors: 1) A shift in lending away from some of the highest emitting companies in the portfolio and the addition of lower emitting companies; and 2) A reduction in the emission rate of the other companies remaining in the portfolio. Having achieved our 2008 target, Bank of America will continue to annually report on the emissions intensity attributed to lending toward the U.S. Utility Portfolio.

As a part of this initiative, we hosted a conference in June 2010 for 100 of our largest and most carbon-- intensive suppliers and senior management across our organization to raise awareness as to carbon issues and collaboratively develop strategies to reduce carbon footprints.

SunPower Corporation,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,AUTOMATIC STOP/START DEVICES
SunPower Corporation,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,"In November 1996, CN began to equip its locomotive switching fleet with automatic stop / start devices.  These devices conserve fuel and reduce emissions by automatically shutting down locomotives when they are not in use, and powering them up again when required to maintain critical locomotive functions.  To date, over 50 percent of CN’s switcher fleet has been retrofitted to employ this feature. Furthermore, all new locomotives purchased by CN, as well as those locomotives that we overhaul, will be equipped with automatic stop / start devices.  As a result, CN has saved more than 1.5 M Litres of fuel throughout our Canadian operations by installing automatic stop / start devices.  This number is based on studies demonstrating that there are annual savings per locomotive on average of 30,000L, and the capital and installation costs can be recouped in approximately 2 years. "
SunPower Corporation,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,LOW IDLE
SunPower Corporation,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,"At CN, we continue to apply the low idle feature to more of our locomotives.  This feature allows the diesel engine to idle at a reduced speed when locomotives are awaiting assignment or coasting down hill, saving approximately 10 litres of fuel per hour.  In addition, on the accepted duty cycles, savings can be up to 1 percent of the fleet annual fuel consumption.  Since 1980, all new locomotives purchased by the Company have had low idle features.  To date, approximately 60 percent of our fleet have applied the low idle feature."

SunPower Corporation,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,LONGER TRAINS
SunPower Corporation,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,"We are working to increase train productivity through the use of longer trains, which permit improved utilization of locomotive power.  In order to enable longer trains, we have invested considerable capital into lengthening passing tracks and sidings, as well as equipping trains with distributed power.  Over the past 10 years, CN has invested CDN$325 Million on siding extensions.  As a result, the Company can run longer, heavier trains, including in cold weather conditions, while improving train handling, reducing train separations and ensuring the overall safety of operations.  In 2009, we spent $400 million to rail infrastructure projects in CNs western region where the Company also invested in extended sidings and terminal improvements to grow its business and permit more efficient movement of traffic in western Canada, including CN’s line to the new Port of Prince Rupert container terminal."
SunPower Corporation,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,"TRAIN PACING, COASTING AND BRAKING STRATEGIES"
SunPower Corporation,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,"Dynamic brake equipment allows the use of the dynamic brake to control train speed variations rather than the use of the air brake system.  As a result, fuel consumption is reduced.  Furthermore, where operations permit, the use of pacing or coasting to stop our trains rather than using heavy braking requiring engine power, has also enabled us to yield fuel and emission reductions.  Pacing is the use of better track / train management by the network management personnel to ensure trains are not rushing to stop at meets.  Meanwhile, coasting takes place when power is removed ahead of time so that the train slows down on its own."

,,,,,,Carbon Capture Trial
,,,,,,"In April 2010 it secured consent from Wakefield District Council to develop at Ferrybridge the UK’s biggest carbon dioxide capture trial facility. The £21m trial will be carried out in collaboration with Doosan Babcock and Vattenfall and will demonstrate the carbon dioxide capture element of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. In March 2009, it secured £6.3m of funding from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Technology Strategy Board and Northern Way. Construction work is expected to start later this year, with the trial itself commencing in 2011 and running through to the end of 2012."
,,,,,,"The scale of the project, equivalent to 5MW of coal-fired power generating capacity producing 100 tonnes of carbon dioxide per day, bridges the gap between the various laboratory-scale trials that are under way and the larger-scale projects envisaged by the UK government. The significance of the project therefore lies in its scale and its ability to demonstrate: the operational characteristics of capture plant on an actual power station; and the performance of the amine solvent on real flue gas."
,,,,,,Renewable Energy
,,,,,,"Assuming it displaced electricity produced from coal-fired power stations, the output of SSE’s wind farms and conventional hydro electric schemes (see below) saved around 4.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2009/10."
,,,,,,Walney Offshore Wind Farm
,,,,,,"SSE’s extensive programme of investment in energy from renewable sources, including the acquisition in December 2009 of a 25.1% stake in the Walney offshore wind farm development, demonstrates its financial commitment to a lower-carbon future."
,,,,,,Walney:
,,,,,,"SSE acquired its 25.1% stake in Walney from DONG Energy, which retains a 74.9% stake, for a total consideration of up to around £39m, of which around £17m is subject to the operational performance of the wind farm. As a shareholder in the project, SSE will pay its pro rata share of the construction costs (just under £250m) with payments being made when each phase of the wind farm is commissioned. Walney will be constructed in two phases, each totalling 183.6MW. Construction of the first phase is now under way, with the first monopiles installed, and construction of the second phase is scheduled to start in the spring of 2011. The wind farm is therefore expected to enter commercial operation in two phases: during the first half of 2011 and towards the end of 2011. DONG Energy is leading the construction and operation of the wind farm. The wind farm is expected to have an average load factor of around 43% and produce around 1,300 GWh of electricity in a typical year. SSE and DONG Energy will market the output of the wind farm in proportion to their equity stakes. Excluding the connection to the Great Britain electricity network, the cost of constructing Walney is expected to total just under £1bn. DONG Energy has provided SSE with financial guarantees relating to the final capital cost of the project and its timely completion."
,,,,,,Dutch Offshore Wind
,,,,,,"In December 2009, SSE and DONG Energy announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to develop three offshore wind farms in the Dutch sector of the North Sea with a total capacity of just over 1,000MW, which SSE previously had the entire right to develop."
,,,,,,Refurbishment of Hydro Stations
,,,,,,"Since the Renewables Obligation was introduced in April 2002, SSE has invested around £450m in refurbishing and developing hydro electric schemes in Scotland. Investment in this area totalled £4.6m during 2009/10."
,,,,,,Sloy Hydro Pumped Storage
,,,,,,"SSE has submitted to Scottish Ministers an application for consent to develop a 60MW pumped storage scheme as part of its 152MW Sloy power station, near Loch Lomond. This means that, in addition to electricity produced from water collected and held in the Loch Sloy reservoir, Sloy would generate electricity using water pumped from Loch Lomond to the reservoir."
,,,,,,"In an average year, Sloy produces around 120GWh of electricity and adding to it a pumped storage facility would allow it to store an additional 100GWh of electricity in a typical year to help meet peak demand. SSE currently expects that developing a pumped storage facility at Sloy will require investment of over £30m."
,,,,,,Clyde:
,,,,,,"Work at the site is continuing, following the resolution of the secondary, and some of the primary, radar-related issues associated with the consent granted for the development. The wind farm is being developed in three sections, with the appointments of the remaining lead contractors for each of the three sections expected to be finalised this year. Clyde is expected to have a load factor of around 35% and produce over 1,000GWh of electricity in a typical year. The first section of the development should be completed by the end of 2011 and the development as a whole in 2012. Its total construction cost is expected to be around £500m."
,,,,,,Griffin:
,,,,,,"Pre-construction work is well under way at the site, in which SSE now has a 100% stake. The annual output is expected to be around 400GWh. Its construction cost is expected to be around £200m and it should be completed in 2012."
,,,,,,Greater Gabbard:
,,,,,,"Following the initial delay in commencing foundation installation, good progress has been made and half of the 140 turbine foundation monopiles and almost one third of the transition pieces have now been installed, as has the first of two transformer platforms. Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited expects to resolve satisfactorily, as part of the normal contractual process, the claim it has received for additional costs relating to foundation monopiles. Commissioning of the onshore sub-station is well-advanced and installation of the first export cable, inter-array cables and turbines is under way. Greater Gabbard is expected to have a load factor of over 40% and produce around 1,900GWh of electricity in a typical year, of which SSE will take 50%. The wind farm is expected to require a total investment by SSE of around £650m, excluding connection to the electricity grid. The development remains on course to be completed in 2012."

,,,,,,"SSE has a 47.8% stake in Aquamarine Power, which in September 2009 successfully completed the first round of its fundraising to raise £10m from investors in the UK and Ireland. This followed the successful deployment of a full scale demonstrator of Aquamarine’s 300kW Oyster wave energy converter at its testing berth at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney. Testing is expected to take up to two years. Aquamarine expects to have a fully commissioned, commercially available wave farm in place by 2014."
,,,,,,Wave and Tidal
,,,,,,"In March 2010, SSE was awarded exclusive rights to develop 400MW of wave and tidal energy at four sites in the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters and a further 400MW with its partners, Aquamarine Power and OpenHydro. The award was part of the world's first commercial leasing programme for wave and tidal energy generation projects, undertaken by The Crown Estate. Over the next few years, SSE and its partners will be working closely with The Crown Estate and other stakeholders before bringing forward applications to construct the wave and tidal energy developments. The vast majority of construction work is not expected to begin until after 2015."
,,,,,,Slough
,,,,,,"SSE’s plant at Slough has a current generating capacity of 80MW and remains the UK’s largest dedicated biomass energy facility. During 2009/10, it produced 136GWh of electricity qualifying for ROCs, compared with 148GWh during the previous year. The output from dedicated regular biomass plants attracts 1.5 ROCs per MWh."
,,,,,,Ferrybridge CHP
,,,,,,SSE has submitted an application for consent to develop a multi-fuel combined heat and power (CHP) facility at Ferrybridge.
,,,,,,"The reliability of fuel sources is a key issue in alternative energy. The proposed multi-fuel CHP facility would use a range of fuel sources, which could include biomass, waste-derived fuels and wood products, to generate 108MW of electricity and to provide heat to the Ferrybridge site. It would be compliant with the Waste Incineration Directive. The development is currently estimated to require investment of around £350m and SSE expects to take a decision on whether to proceed with it in the course of the next year."
,,,,,,Barkip Biogas
,,,,,,"In May 2010, SSE agreed to invest a net £11.3m to allow the construction of Scotland’s largest biogas plant at the former landfill site at Barkip in North Ayrshire. The deal made SSE the first energy company in the UK to commit to the construction and operation of an anaerobic digestion biogas plant of this type. The Barkip site will be capable of processing around 80,000 tonnes of waste annually, producing enough gas to generate up to 2MW of electricity. The new project will enable SSE to gain experience in owning and operating this technology, which it believes could offer opportunities beyond on-site electricity generation, including connection to the gas distribution network in the future."
,,,,,,Forth Energy
,,,,,,"Forth Energy, the joint venture between SSE and Forth Ports PLC created in 2008, has prepared proposals for the development of dedicated biomass power stations at four of Forth Ports’ sites in Scotland. It is undertaking consultations on the proposals and intends to seek consent during the course of this year to build the plants. The plants are proposed for Dundee, Leith, Rosyth and Grangemouth. Their total installed capacity would be around 400MW and they could also produce heat to be used at other facilities at the Forth Ports’ sites and, potentially, other neighbouring sites."
,,,,,,BiFab
,,,,,,"in April 2010, SSE purchased a 15% stake in Burntisland Fabrications Ltd for a total consideration of £11m. In addition to the equity stake, SSE has secured an agreement with BiFab for the supply of at least 50 jacket substructures annually to support SSE’s offshore wind developments."
,,,,,,BiFab is an established fabricator of structures and equipment for the oil and gas industry which has recently extended its expertise into the fabrication of jacket substructures suitable for offshore wind developments. BiFab has already attracted government support to develop a new manufacturing facility for offshore wind jacket substructures. SSE’s investment will be used to further develop this facility and this is expected to expand BiFab’s capabilities to a total annual capacity of up to 130 units. The investment follows BiFab’s successful delivery of jackets for the Greater Gabbard offshore wind project.
,,,,,,Nuclear
,,,,,,"During 2009, a consortium of GDF Suez SA, Iberdrola SA and SSE, in which SSE has a 25% stake, secured an option to purchase from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority land for the development of new nuclear power generating plant adjacent to Sellafield in Cumbria, for a total cash consideration that could reach £70m."
,,,,,,"The consortium now intends to prepare detailed plans for developing new nuclear power plant at the site with a total capacity of up to 3.6GW. These plans will be prepared in consultation with the safety authorities and local stakeholders and will be submitted for consideration by the relevant planning authorities, with the aim of being able to begin construction of the first new reactor around 2014. On this basis, the new power station would not be commissioned before 2020."
,,,,,,M&S Energy
,,,,,,"The total also includes M&S Energy, a dual fuel product launched in October 2008 by SSE and Marks & Spencer (M&S). The product is available to M&S customers exclusively through M&S’ stores and website, and by 31 March 2010 had attracted 175,000 customer accounts."
,,,,,,CERT
,,,,,,"In 2009/10 funded the installation of cavity wall insulation in 146,000 homes and loft insulation in 128,000 homes (excluding DIY insulation). This is up from 87,000 homes and 104,000 homes respectively."
,,,,,,Better Plan
,,,,,,"SSE launched ‘better plan’ towards the end of 2007 as part of its commitment to work in partnership with its customers to help them reduce their energy use and to create a more sustainable level of energy consumption. During 2009/10, customers with an additional 50,000 energy accounts joined ‘better plan’, taking the total to 215,000."
,,,,,,Smart Grids
,,,,,,"SSE and Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd have commercially deployed smart grid technology on SSE's power distribution network on Orkney, allowing the connection of 15MW of extra new renewable energy generation, an increase of one third, with the potential for this to grow further. The Orkney Smart Grid is based on the principle that capacity exists in real-time on the power distribution grid due to variation in demand for electricity and diversity in the output of grid-connected generators. This innovative smart grid technology permits greater numbers of renewable generators to be connected to the existing electricity network, in a cheaper and faster way than traditional means, by allowing generators to access power network capacity not normally available under conventional network planning requirements."
,,,,,,"The connection of similar levels of renewable generation on Orkney by the conventional means of network reinforcement would have cost around £30m, compared with smart-related costs of less than £1m."
,,,,,,Electric Vehicles
,,,,,,"SSE is taking part in the Technology Strategy Board’s Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstration (ULCVD) project, which consists of eight consortia bringing over 300 vehicles to trial. The two consortia in which SSE is involved are with:"

,,,,,,Zero Carbon Homes
,,,,,,"SSE is to become the first utility in the UK to build and monitor its own development of zero-carbon homes. The 10-home development, under construction near Slough, is being built on land previously occupied by an SSE office building. The properties have been designed to achieve the highest specification for sustainable building, Code Level 6 in the Code for Sustainable Homes. The installation of renewable energy features will be carried out by SSE Contracting and SSE Utility Solutions. All new homes built in England from 2016 onwards must be zero carbon."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"In one of the first ever live demonstrations of what will be needed to achieve highly energy efficient living, SSE will test the every-day performance of the technology installed in the homes, such as a photovoltaic (solar) roof and a renewable district heating system. The development will feature a renewable energy heat hub, housing five different types of micro-generation including air and ground source heat pumps, a biomass boiler and solar thermal panels. The homes will be fitted with the latest energy efficient appliances and SSE will use smart meters to monitor the energy and water usage of the homes for 24 months."
,,,,,,"The information gleaned will help SSE understand how householders respond and adapt to zero-carbon living. It will also provide SSE and its related companies, such as those linked with SSE Ventures, with valuable information to share with stakeholders such as construction partners, technology manufacturers and industry bodies."
,,,,,,EDRP
,,,,,,"In early 2010, SSE successfully completed the first community-wide energy reduction trials in the UK, helping two communities achieve a 10% reduction in their electricity consumption. The trials, part of the Energy Research Demand Project (EDRP), involved working with communities to help them achieve the reduction over a two-and-a-half-year period."
,,,,,,"The EDRP trials are managed by Ofgem, on behalf of the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, and aim to gain an understanding of how consumers react to improved information about their energy consumption. The trials consist of different elements using different methods to provide feedback on energy consumption."
,,,,,,"SSE was the only energy supplier in the EDRP to hold trials involving engagement with entire communities. The trials were held in North Leigh in Oxfordshire, Alyth in Perthshire and St Athan in South Wales. The communities of North Leigh and Alyth achieved their community-wide 10% energy reduction and received an award of £20,000 each from SSE. The trial in St Athan started later, and is therefore not due to be completed until later this year, but good progress is being made."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"A variety of measures was available to each community including smart meters, real-time display devices (which show energy use in monetary value), energy efficiency advice and insulation offers."
,,,,,,Big Green Commuter Challenge

,,,,,,"CP perseveres in our search for a fuel efficient switcher locomotive replacement.  Locomotive specifications were sent to all established builders as well as new potential locomotive builders with a challenge to provide their version of a 4-axle switching locomotive solution.  The response was enthusiastic and seven builders emerged with their designs and commitments to build a prototype.  So far, CP has evaluated four prototypes with two more scheduled for spring 2010.  CP will be able to apply this knowledge to our 6-axle fleet (SD40s) renewal strategy."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"With the support of Transport Canada’s Freight Technology Demonstration Fund, CP acquired two new National Railway Equipment Genset locomotives for testing in southern Ontario.  These units could reduce fuel consumption by up to 40% and air pollutants by between 80 and 90% compared to existing switching locomotives."
,,,,,,3. Idle Reduction
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"CP has applied automatic engine start stop technology to 95% of our yard engines and 80% of our road fleet.  This technology limits idling to only what is necessary to protect the engine and has resulted in a reduction of 40 million litres of fuel since 2002.  The systems operate all year, however, the shut down opportunity is currently restricted to above-freezing temperatures."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"CP is currently testing a new generation anti-idling technology, known as a self-contained layover system,  that will operate without any temperature restrictions.  Fuel savings of three times the typical start-stop systems is anticipated."
,,,,,,4. Fuel Trip Optimizer
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Following operational testing which indicated fuel savings ranging from 6 to more than 10% depending on territory, CP has equipped all 200 GE Evolution locomotives with GE Tranpsortation’s Fuel Trip Optimizer (FTO).  This is the product’s first commercial deployment.  FTO is an advanced energy management system that optimizes fuel consumption based on a specific train’s configuration and the route traveled."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"The system evaluates train length, weight, grade, track conditions, weather and locomotive performance to calculate the most efficient way of running the train while maintaining smooth train handling.  Operation of FTO is similar to the autopilot feature in today’s jetliners.  Train crews retain responsibility for safe operation of the train and can engage or disengage the system at any time."
,,,,,,5. Rail Lubrication
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"In areas with high track curvature, the resulting wear on the track and wheel impacts fuel consumption of the trains.  CP is implementing a total friction management approach which involves a combination of both gauge face and top of rail lubrication to reduce rail and wheel wear on high curvature track.  The focus has been on a 900 mile section in Western Canada where over 300 top of rail lubrication systems have been installed.  In combination with existing gauge face lubrication sites, the estimated annual fuel savings is almost 7 million litres."
,,,,,,6.  Operating Plan Strategies
,,,,,,
,,,,,,Operating plan strategies involve efforts to increase the capacity of our core franchise and improve fluidity in the overall rail network.  These improvements also result in reductions in GHG emissions due to more efficient train movements.
,,,,,,
,,,,,,Pacing
,,,,,,
,,,,,,Rail traffic controllers have the ability to pace trains over a territory to minimize fuel consumption while maintaining a given level of performance.  Pacing charts are used to determine optimal performance for the locomotives not equipped with FTO.
,,,,,,
,,,,,,Distributed Power
,,,,,,
,,,,,,CP is analyzing the effects of various power distribution models (number and position of locomotives within the train consist) to achieve the lowest overall system cost including fuel consumption.
,,,,,,
,,,,,,Co-production Agreements
,,,,,,
,,,,,,CP has expanded its physical network and capacity through various innovative infrastructure sharing and joint service programs with other railways which also serve to improve GHG and fuel efficiencies. 
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Other initiatives include 45 mph speed restrictions on non-expedited trains, the use of dynamic braking over power braking at higher throttle positions and optimizing HP/ton ratios."
,,,,,,7.  Railcar Fleet Modernization
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Starting in 1998, CP has undertaken a freight car modernization program to fully leverage its rail network and locomotive fleet.  These cars are lighter and yet have higher capacity.  New automotive carriers, covered hoppers, open tops, box cars, gondolas and flats can carry more goods more efficiently. In the last two decades CP has spent over $1.5B on acquiring new high capacity rail cars to further improve operating and fuel efficiencies."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Double-stacking and improved standardization of containers has further improved the density of Intermodal trains.  To accommodate the new double stack height, significant capital dollars were expended raising the clearance in railway tunnels."
,,,,,,8.  Biodiesel Demonstration Project
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Preparing for the future, CP has partnered with Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to test the reliability of a 5% biodiesel blend fuel in railway service under cold weather conditions."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Over a five month period ending March 31, 2010, four biodiesel-powered GE AC4400 locomotives, a model which make up 75% of our active fleet,  operated in daily service between Calgary and Edmonton.  This will allow us to (i) evaluate locomotive performance; (ii) identify potential implications on maintenance and replacement frequency of engine components; (iii) evaluate potential fuel efficiency implications; and (iv) share results with the federal government and other railways in advance of proposed regulation. "
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Mandating the introduction of biodiesel, considered a cleaner, renewable alternative to traditional fuels, into the fuel supply system is one of the federal government’s strategies to reduce Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions."
,,,,,,"Adoption of biomass in power matrix, substitution of oil by natural gas fired kilns, flex fuel automotive fleet (service cars, not industrial vehicles), instalation of industrial filters, among others."
,,,,,,"GE uses the Energy Treasure Hunt, a Lean Manufacturing based process created by Toyota Manufacturing North America, to engage employees and identify projects that drive energy efficiency.  The process is a structured multidisciplinary review of the energy use at a faciity. GE has identified and implemented numerous cost effective projects to upgrade lighting, HVAC, and industrial process equipment and to better manage energy use through more than 200 Treasure Hunt events since 2005.  GE also offers rewards and recognition to sites that reduce GHG emissions.  In 2009, GE recognized 50 of its sites as eCO2 award winners. These sites had at least a five percent reduction in GHG emissions versus the baseline year independent of changes in production levels."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Data for this answer was obtained from GE's Project Deck, an internal GHG reduction and energy efficiency project tracking data base. Data represents the results reported by GE site and business personnel for those projects that were reported as being completed during 2005 to 2009. The annual energy savings are the reported annual kWh of electricty saved by the projects. Additional energy savings may have resulted from reduced or more efficient use of fuels. The GHG emission reductions are the reported annual reductions achieved by the projects. The investment number is the total reported capital investments and expenses needed to implement the projects. Additional operating and maintenance expenditures from 2005 to 2009 have been approximately $4,000,000. The monetary savings number is the reported cumulative savings from the projects from 2005 to 2009."

Controls are frequently placed on equipment to capture emissions, including methane. Captured emissions are returned to production or used as fuel in our operations. EOG frequently reviews energy use and efficiency and takes actions to reduce consumption and improve efficiency as a normal part of our operations. In some areas, we have installed electric or dual-fuel compressors as a result of these energy reviews. Additionally, in support of recent regulatory initiatives, EOG has accelerated the use of electric-driven compression in certain regions of the U.S. to lessen the emissions generated in those areas. In relocating to a new building, EOG considered energy use and efficiency as one of our priorities in designing the space and selecting new energy efficient lights that turn off after a period of no movement."

,,,,,,"External signage - In Canadian and international locations, we exclusively use highly efficient LED lighting for new individual letter signs. We also install timers on exterior signs to ensure that exterior lights only turn on after dark..  By changing our standard to LED channel letter signage (from fluorescent box signs), we spend $2,200 more a sign, often 2 to 3 per branch. We save $230 or 2,300 KWh per year per sign, for an approximate 9 year payback period."
,,,,,,"Exit lights - We have completed a retrofit program to convert the exit sign lighting in 500 of our Canadian branches from incandescent bulbs to highly efficient LED bulbs.  We save 450 KWh per branch per year or approximately 22,500 per year for a 2.4 year payback period."
,,,,,,"Roofing - We include white-coloured roofs in our new Canadian and international branch design specifications for climate-appropriate locations. These roofs reflect heat during the warm months of the year which, in turn, reduces our air conditioning consumption, and the ""heat island"" effect in major metropolitan centres."
,,,,,,"Heat recovery ventilators - For climate-appropriate locations, wherever possible, we are installing ventilators to recover ""waste heat"" from exhaust air, which is then used to preheat incoming fresh air. The cost per branch is $10,000, with an annual savings of $2,500 from decrease in energy use, and we save 25,000 KWh per branch per year"
,,,,,,"Nightly thermostat adjustments - Where practical and within our control, we install thermostat set-back devices in our branches to automatically adjust temperatures. We spend  $250 x 7 units = $1,750  per branch. We save approximately 10% in energy for heating and cooling energy per branch.  The extra capital costs per branch for the chosen thermostats is approximately $1,250 (over a standard unit). The estimated savings is $360 per year or 3,600 KWh per year for a payback of 3.5 years."
,,,,,,"High efficiency roof-top HVAC units: We are installing, where possible and within our control, high efficiency heating and cooling roof top units in new Canadian and international branches.These units reduce energy consumption, and employ friendlier, non-CFC refrigerants."
,,,,,,"Heat sensor light switches: We are installing ""passive radiant heat"" sensors in utility rooms in our new branches. Lighting turns on and remains on only when people are in the room.  We spend  $180 per unit.,  with approximately 14 per branch or $2,520 in capital per branch. The estimated energy savings is 750 KWh per branch per year."
,,,,,,"Exhaust fans timer controls - For all of our new branches, we are installing, wherever possible, controls that will automatically shut off exhaust fans in lunchrooms and bathrooms after a set period from when the lighting is turned off. We spend $250 x 3 units per branch = $750 in extra capital per branch and save approximately 1,000 KWh per year."
,,,,,,"Window coatings - Wherever practical and within our control, in our new branches, we install ""Low-E"" windows. These windows reflect sunlight in warmer months, but allow sunlight to pass through the windows in colder months"
,,,,,,"Videoconferencing - We now have video conferencing technology in 24 locations, from Toronto to Santiago, Chile, and employee usage continues to grow. Video conferencing saves money  as well as GHG emissions from air and car travel.  On average during 2009, Bank employees participated in 50 point-to-point meetings and 22 multi-point meetings, enabling the Bank to avoid an estimated 67 business trips per month. To date, approximately 85 video conferencing units have been deployed globally."
,,,,,,"Carpet - Environmentally friendly carpet is the standard carpet that we use for our branches and office premises around the world. It contains a minimum 45% recycled content, and meets the highest indoor air quality rating, as established by the Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI Green Label Plus). In 2009, we purchased and installed 39,617 square yards of environmentally friendly carpet for various Scotiabank facilities. As a result, we will permanently reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 585 tons, which represents the total life-cycle impact of this purchase. 100% of our carpets are recycled at the end of their useful lives."
,,,,,,"Energy usage of office equipment - Scotiabank's standard Request for Proposal (RFP) documents address energy usage of office equipment such as computers, faxes and photocopiers in order to assess the energy efficiency of the Bank's purchases. In 2009 the Bank rolled out the installation of MultiFunctional Devices (a fax, photocopier and printer all in one) which will have a significant impact on energy use."
,,,,,,"Data centres - Scotiabank, in partnership with IBM, is ""greening"" our data centre facilities, which can consume considerable energy since they typically operate hundreds of servers. IBM has helped Scotiabank by ""virtualizing"" servers, to allow the Bank to spread systems needs among fewer, larger servers"
,,,,,,"Updated lighting design for new locations -Use of new T5s. New design reduces per sq.ft. wattage from .73 to .33. For a typical branch, .40 KWh per sq. ft x 5.000 sq. ft (ave. branch size) x 9hrs x 6 days a week x 52 weeks / 1,000. T5s are more expensive but use less electricity so there is no extra cost."

,,,,,,"- Airbus’s Stade plant near Hamburg, in Germany, is one of the world’s leading centers for production of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP). Through a combined heat and power (CHP) unit, management has achieved a step change in energy efficiency. The unit burns gases to generate power, but the waste gases (mainly CO2) are then used in the process of curing CFRP at high pressure. Being chemically inert gases, they provide a non-combustible atmosphere during curing. In the past, the method for obtaining nitrogen from the air for this process was extremely energy-intensive. The reduction in energy costs from the curing process alone means the investment in the CHP unit can be recovered in just one year. Furthermore, the CO2 emitted is recycled, meaning the CHP unit produces almost no pollutants, and the waste heat is used to heat hangars and offices."

,,,,,,- Woolworths has already taken steps to reduce vehicle emissions by recycling used cooking oil to generate a 5% bio-diesel mix in part of our fleet resulting in a saving of 1500 tons of CO2 per annum. Technical requirements from Mercedes Benz in Germany are delaying an increase in the percentage blend used.
,,,,,,"- Increase in distributable units distributed per litre of diesel used and per kilometre travelled. Target: 2012 targets of 9.7 DU/litre and 4.44 DU/km. n the last financial year, we reported that the real cost of distribution per unit reduced over the last three years."
,,,,,,"- Woolworths sources over 95% of our food locally, based on country of origin labelling."
,,,,,,- Less that 0.1% of our food is air-freighted and we ensure that we only use this form of transport where local alternatives are not available.
,,,,,,#NAME?
,,,,,,"- Reducing fuel consumption through the use of Euro 5 technology in conjunction with Imperial. 5 new vehicles are being used to trial this programme. Euro 4 technology is only required by 2014 in terms of current SA legislation, so we feel the programme gives us a significant advantage. Engen is ensuring the availability of low sulphur diesel for us. The Euro 5 trucks are being equipped with Bluetec technology with 80% fewer particles and 60% less nitrous oxide and a 2-5% fuel saving, estimated at 600 000 litres of diesel per year."
,,,,,,"- Improving refrigeration through the eco-fridge project. By using nitrogen refrigeration in our fleet, we estimate an approximate saving of 3000 tons of CO2 per annum, through diesel reductions, as well as efficiency benefits and noise reductions. The first four units are currently on the road."
,,,,,,"Energy efficiency - includes upgrading pumps & compressors, lighting & HVAC, insulation, heating, chillers / coolers, installing / optimising thermal oxidisers. These cover all business groups.  Due to the large number of such projects, not all energy efficiency projects were able to be captured for this report, so the true value of energy and emissions savings will be greater."

The building is designed to use as liittle energy as possible, withroof windows and sun lights to bring natural daylight, energy efficient heating and air conditioning (including heat recovery from fridges and freezers), efficient equipment such as bakery ovens, and LED lighting. The residual energy needed is generated on site from a renewable fuel-powered CHP plant. The store also has a CO2-based refrigeration system. It cost 30% more to build than a standard store of similar size (exact figures are commercially sensitive) and uses 45% less energy than a standard store, which means that the extra cost will be paid back through energy savings within only a few years."

A total of 184,619 lamps were replaced (39,513 on surface and 145,106 underground)."
,,,,,,Compressed air optimisation to be achieved by the intelligent control of the distribution and consumption of compressed air in Anglo Platinum's underground mines.
,,,,,,"Ventilation fan optimisation. Studies into the characteristics of the main surface ventilation fans have shown that energy can be saved by throttling the fans back during times when less air is required in the mines (e.g. on Sundays). This is achieved by adjusting the inlet guide vanes to the fan. Whereas this adjustment was done only periodically in the past to match the fan output to the required maximum duty, it was realised that an active control system on the guide vanes could save a significant amount of energy."
,,,,,,"Reduction of limestone to the furnaces. Previously, the addition of limestone to the furnaces consumed approximately 1 MWh/t limestone. Removal of limestone from the furnaces frees this energy up to be applied to the smelting of additional new concentrate, effectively lowering the specific energy consumption (SEC) in MWh/t of new concentrate smelted.  With a reduced limestone addition of 7%, a roughly 10% higher amount of concentrate can be smelted, all else being equal. This results in an effective 10% lowering in specific energy consumption."
,,,,,,"Heat pumps were installed at the change-houses at both shafts at the Bafokeng-Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM). The success of the BRPM installation led to a decision to install heat pumps at the mines based in Rustenburg, Tumela and Dishaba. A study is also being done at Union Mine to install heat pumps at both change houses and the mine houses in the village."
,,,,,,"Sustainability and Extraction Efficiency (SEE). The SEE project developed as a result of a study on Mine to Mill (M2M) and discussions about the future of the concept. M2M is essentially about blasting the ideal fragmentation to improve throughput in the downstream processing plant. It crosses the boundary between mining and process, and requires good communication between, and understanding of, both functions. SEE is essentially a software simulation package that will enable integration of the mining and processing functions. The scope has been extended in both directions along the value chain so that it is no longer ‘Mine to Mill’ but ‘Resource to Market’. Phase 1 of SEE is limited to the final concentrate, not final metal. Future phases of the project will extend the value chain further. SEE modelling software allows for the optimisation of recovery by altering the mine plan to suit ore blending and scheduling into a concentrator. The SEE project will measure recovered ounces, overall cost, energy consumption, CO2e emissions and water consumption. The SEE software is currently being implemented at Anglo Platinum’s Mogalakwena operation."
,,,,,,"Optimisation. An example of process optimisation is the alignment of process activities, such as reducing the quantity of steel balls in the milling circuit when the production is capped. This will reduce the energy demand during periods of lower production although the energy intensity per ton of concentrate remains the same. In 2009 when the production of high-grade PGM-bearing concentrate was capped at 2.5 million tons, the corresponding energy consumption was reduced by 15% through the alignment of process activities. The optimisation of crushing and grinding systems is still ongoing. The management of smelter load also offers energy efficiency opportunities."
,,,,,,"Transportation. The use of LAROX filters has resulted in the transportation of product with lower moisture content, which is more efficient as fewer trips need to be made. Anglo Platinum has procedures in place at its operations to ensure that trucks are optimally loaded, in order to avoid transporting air. The number of locomotives used to transport ore and waste-rock has been reduced and they have all been replaced with new ‘millennium locos’. These come already fitted with improved lighting, a better seating configuration, roll-over protection and proximity devices. On-surface railway engine procedures are now in place to switch off engines as it was found that engines sometimes idled for 8 hours previously. Some diesel Caterpillars have been replaced with AC driven Komatso trucks, which are more efficient."
,,,,,,Refrigeration plants. The refrigeration plants are switched off during winter. A modified Rankin cycle refrigerator/ generator which will reuse of waste heat are being evaluated.
,,,,,,A rock hydro project is being investigated. It operates on a similar premise as a water wheel. Rocks at the end of conveyor belt fall on a wheel causing it to turn and generate electricity. There is a pilot plant at Mogalakwena which is testing to see what torque can be delivered to a generator.
,,,,,,The possible inclusion of a solar-powered refrigeration plant will be investigated at the Amandelbult 4 shaft project when this is reinstated in future.
,,,,,,Investigations continue into the use of electric instead of pneumatic rock drilling and the use of non-pneumatic mining technologies.
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Energy savings programme:  In 2010 we implemented projects which save more than 100 GWh of energy and 41,800 tonnes of CO2 a year by finding ways to reduce energy use at no cost, for example by switching off legacy network equipment, server virtualisation, reducing office space, conducting building energy audits and raising employee awareness about energy efficiency."
,,,,,,"Energy Efficiency capital investment programme invested over £4m in 2010;  EC fan retrofit programme at 228 sites, Building Energy Management System at 39 sites, Variable Speed Drive installations to existing fan & pump motors at 36 sites,  Boiler load optimisation at 23 sites, Lighting scheme at Magna Park site, Central chiller upgrades at 7 sites.  We have budgeted to quadruple this investment to over £16m in 2011 financial year;  £15m is allocated for projects in the UK."
,,,,,,"Renewable & low carbon energy:  Nearly all of the electricity we use in the UK comes from renewable sources. The renewal of our green energy contract until 2014 means we continue to meet approximately 40% of our electricity needs in the UK from renewable sources, and almost 60% from combined heat and power generation. We have low-carbon energy contracts in Germany and Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg.  We also have invested in on-site renewables in the UK and at our US headquarters in El Segundo, California where we installed photovoltaic panels (solar panels), some of which can follow the sun to maximise their output. The panels are designed to produce around 1,000 MWh of energy each year."
,,,,,,Our own wind farms:  In 2007 we announced plans to develop our own wind-farms. BT Wind for Change is the UK’s biggest corporate wind power project outside the energy sector.
,,,,,,"Openreach (part of the BT Group) installs and maintains the wiring, fibres and connections from homes and businesses in Britain to the networks used by their communications providers. Openreach operates commercial and car fleets of 25,000 vehicles, comprising over 70% of BT’s total fleet.  Since 2006, Openreach has reduced the overall fault rate in our network by around 30%, which has meant fewer engineering visits, better customer satisfaction, lower costs and lower CO2 emissions."
,,,,,,"Reducing Air travel:  We encourage our employees to use low carbon travel and to use BT’s conferencing facilities wherever possible to avoid travel altogether. All business flights are booked via our travel management company and all air travel is pre-authorised.  BT has become the first company to cut 20% of its business flights as part of WWF's One in Five Challenge, a programme that helps companies to reduce their reliance on flying, in favour of lower carbon alternatives. This was partly achieved by increasing the use of our voice, video and web conferencing services, avoiding the need to fly or travel over land to meetings. BT is piloting tools to raise awareness of the cost and carbon implications associated with business travel which will enable employees to make more informed choices about their modes of travel."

,,,,,,Refurbishment of hydro power:
,,,,,,"Refurbishments of twenty-one hydro power plants in Finnish and Swedish rivers have been implemented since 1991. Refurbishments are part of Fortum's extensive hydro power refurbishment programme. The projects included e.g. modernisation, service and maintenance operations of the generator, turbine and electricity and automation systems. The refurbishments together have resulted in an increase of 72 MW in the electric output of the units. The average annual increase of electricity generation is estimated to be about 170 GWh."
,,,,,,Upgrading and modernisation of nuclear power plants:
,,,,,,"During the projects, the thermal power of several nuclear power plants have been upgraded and together with these and certain other measures to improve the turbine efficiency, an increase of about 778 MW in the electrical output of the power plants have been possible. The annual average additional energy due to the projects has been about 4.8 TWh in 2008-2009."
,,,,,,Construction of wind power plants:
,,,,,,Fortum has shares in several wind power companies that have constructed wind mills. The installed capacity (Fortum's share) is about 6 MW and estimated annual generation about 11 GWh
,,,,,,Construction of Kirkniemi CCGT plant:
,,,,,,"The construction of a new gas-fired combined-cycle power plant was completed in 1997. Also, new gas burners were fitted in one of the old boilers in 1997. Due to the project, the fuel usage of the power plant changed almost totally: coal was the main fuel earlier and nowadays, the fuel share of natural gas is about 90 %. The wood based fuels have been used in both systems, but in the current system, the amount of wood in form bark is larger than in the older system."
,,,,,,"The electricity heat ratio (electricity generation / produced heat) of the CHP plant is much higher than the ratio of the old power plant. In the old power plant, the heat electricity ratio was less than 0.2 and currently, it is almost 0.9."
,,,,,,Fuel switching at Kauttua CHP plant:
,,,,,,The use of biomass based and recycled solid fuels (REF) have been increased since 1990. Coal and peat have been replaced. New solid fuel reception and handling terminal with conveyor and crusher was built. New PDF storage for incompact waste paper was built. Fortum has owned the industrial power plant Kauttua since 1991.
,,,,,,Fuel switching at Värtan CHP plant:
,,,,,,"Testing of different bio oils in order to move from fossil oils to renewable fuels which is in line with EU directives to increase the amount of renewable energy produced. Also, olives have been used to replace fossil fuels."
,,,,,,Construction of Kuusamo CHP plant:
,,,,,,"A new combined heat and power (CHP) plant has been commissioned in 1994. In the earlier district heat system only heat was produced. The new power plant produces nearly all district heat consumed in the town of Kuusamo. Main fuels of the CHP plant are indigenous fuels (peat, wood)."
,,,,,,Kuusamo CHP plant is based on fluidised bed combustion technology. It is equipped with peat drying technology which enables heat recovery and its utilisation in district heat production.
,,,,,,New boiler at Högdalen CHP plant:
,,,,,,The new boiler was built to produce more steam for the Stockholm south dictrict heating system as well as increasing the electricity output of the Högdalen plant. When the decision to build a new boiler was taken there were also concerns about the future use of existing boilers in Högdalen due to new EU legislation. However it was possible to keep existing boilers in a modified version.  The new boiler has a capacity to incinerate 34 t waste/h.
,,,,,,Fuel switching at Hässelby CHP plant:
,,,,,,"In 1992, it was decided to stop coal-firing in Hässelby and to apply for a permit to fire wood pellets instead of coal. Plans to introduce bio-fuels and still use the main parts of the coal-firing equipment resulted in the construction of trail-firing with wood pellets. Since then, the woodpellet-firing capacity has increased year by year and by the early 2000s the Hässelby plant was almost totally converted to bio-fuel.When the Hässelby plant started woodpellet  firing, the supply of wood pellets  was limited. The conversion from coal to bio-fuels not only involved the conversion of the plant, it also meant that new woodpellet  factories had to be built."
,,,,,,Boiler conversion at Uimaharju CHP plant:
,,,,,,The old soda recovery boiler was converted to BFB bark boiler and a new turbine plant was built. The electricity steam ratio (electricity generation / heat production) of the CHP plant has increased from about 0.13 to 0.35.
,,,,,,Boiler conversion at Joensuu CHP plant:
,,,,,,"Boiler conversion at Joensuu CHP Plant was implemented in 2000. In the project, the earlier pulverised peat milling, drying and firing system was converted into a bubbling fluidised bed boiler (BFB). Boiler conversion enabled wider fuel range and additional use of wood fuel. Due to the boiler retrofit the share of biomass has increased from 4.0% (in the beginning of 1990's) to 30-60%. The use of biomass based fuels has varied between 380 GWh/a and 680 GWh/a in 2001-2007."
,,,,,,The Joensuu Power Plant supplies district heat for the town of Joensuu and electricity for the Finnish grid. The plant was commissioned in 1986.
,,,,,,Porcupine use of biosolids
,,,,,,"By rehabilitating old and abandoned tailings sites and waste rock dumps using biosolids, Porcupine is effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Close to one hundred thousand tonnes per year of pulp and paper biosolids are diverted from landfills and are used as a soil amendment material by Porcupine. If this waste material was placed in landfills, it would decompose anaerobically (without air) producing methane gas. Methane has a global warming potential of around 23 (averaged over 100 years). However, placed in a thin layer on top of tailings or rock piles, the biosolids will decompose aerobically, releasing carbon dioxide instead of methane. Reusing this material instead of disposing of it as a waste to landfill results in a significant potential saving of greenhouse gas emissions."
,,,,,,Musselwhite solar wall
,,,,,,"Musselwhite has installed a SolarWall® in its mechanical workshop. The wall is designed to heat the ventilation air using a patented unglazed perforated collector. Preliminary calculations indicate that the SolarWall® can save approximately 2,000 GJ of energy per year, equal to about 180 tonnes of CO2e saved from release to the atmosphere in a five month winter season."
,,,,,,Las Truchas hydroelectric enhancement project
,,,,,,"Goldcorp Mexico’s San Dimas mine is the biggest user of the Las Truchas hydro plant’s electricity and the recent expansion will ensure that Las Truchas is able to supply most of the mine’s increased demand for electricity. The upgraded facilities were completed in May 2008, and have the capacity to supply an additional 7,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity. In 2009, Las Truchas supplied 87% of the power requirements of San Dimas, which amounted to a saving of 23,500 tonnes of CO2e greenhouse gas emissions over 100% use of power from the Mexican grid."
,,,,,,Marigold improved fuel efficiencies
,,,,,,"In 2002, Marigold made the decision to replace its existing truck fleet of 172-tonne diesel fuelled/mechanical drive haul trucks. Six 272-tonne diesel fuelled/electric drive trucks were added to the truck fleet in 2004. The 272-tonne diesel fuelled/electric drive trucks were a new product with limited historic performance information and Marigold opted to purchase these trucks on an evaluation/comparison basis. During the first year of the evaluation/comparison it was confirmed that a 272-ton diesel fuelled/electric drive truck consumes 0.23 litres of diesel fuel per tonne of material moved versus 0.34 litres of diesel fuel per tonne of material moved with the 172 tonne diesel fuelled/mechanical drive haul trucks, greatly reducing the amount of diesel fuel consumed per tonne of material moved. Marigold supplemented its truck fleet with six additional diesel fuelled/electric drive trucks in 2009. The mine now employs the strategy of using all of the 272 tonne diesel fuelled/electric trucks available on any given shift, with enough 172 tonne diesel fuelled/mechanical trucks to match loading capacity.

,,,,,,To date we have installed meters at 55 sites. The project is continuing throughout 2010.
,,,,,,Sustainable IT:
,,,,,,"WPP's personal and network IT equipment accounts for a large proportion of our energy use. We aim to cut the energy used by our computers by up to 30%. We have introduced requirements to improve the energy efficiency of our IT equipment. For example, all new computers must comply with our power consumption standards for desktops, laptops and servers; only approved devices can be purchased; and power management features must be enabled on all IT equipment."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,Through our server virtualisation program and the use of new energy-efficient blade-based server technology we aim to achieve up to 40% reduction in power consumption for key IT applications. We successfully piloted this approach in 2009 with the Group financial reporting IT systems and are adopting the approach as standard for future server installations and upgrades.
,,,,,,Managing Print:
,,,,,,"In 2009 WPP completed pilot projects at three London companies to find ways to cut the amount of energy used by our printers and to reduce the amount of ink, toner and paper. The projects involved combining copiers, printers and scanners in one device; removing printers from desks to a central location and minimising the numbers of printers in use; implementing default settings to  save energy, ink, toner and paper (e.g. double sided printing and black and white settings); implementing 'follow me' printing. This means that print jobs will only be delivered when people swipe a key card on the printer, reducing the number of unwanted print jobs; introducing software to prevent waste through poor formatting; reducing waste in procurement of ink, toner and paper; negotiating recycling arrangements with manufacturers of ink and toner cartridges."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,The projects have bought significant savings and in 2010 we will expand managed print projects to key markets.
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"We expect these measures to reduce paper, toner and energy use by between 20% and 30% at the sites where they are implemented."
,,,,,,Reducing travel through videoconferencing:
,,,,,,"We encourage people to meet via video conferencing, avoiding the cost and environmental impact of travelling to meetings. We are setting up facilities in key cities around the world. By the end of 2009, we had set up 40 shared high-definition videoconferencing units around the world which can be used by any WPP company. In 2010 we will install another 35 shared units, bringing the total to 75 shared units."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,In 2009 we launched a videoconferencing search and booking system on the WPP intranet which includes a carbon calculator to show the amount of CO2 avoided by using videoconferencing rather than flying to a meeting.
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"In the first 4 months since the service was launched in September 2009, our companies held 1,853 hours of meetings via videoconference using the shared units. We do not track data for use of videoconferencing units owned and operated by individual companies."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,In 2010 we will continue our communications plan to raise awareness and increase use of the facilities.
,,,,,,Buying renewable energy:
,,,,,,"WPP purchases renewable energy where possible and regularly reviews energy sourcing across all markets to identify new opportunities. We estimate that around 15% of the total energy we purchase worldwide is from renewable sources. In the UK 57% of the electricity purchased is from renewable sources. When rated at zero emissions, WPP's renewable energy purchases reduce our carbon footprint by 27,073 tonnes of CO2."
,,,,,,"WPP has Energy Action Teams in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. These include member of our IT, real estate and procurement functions. Their job is to identify energy-saving measures and provide technical guidance to our agencies on energy reduction. The teams are supported by a network of Climate Champions who help to implement energy-saving measures and raise awareness of our climate change program in our companies. The energy-saving measures range from simple actions, such as ensuring that lights are switched off, to more complex measures like setting up a recycling system."
,,,,,,Environmental building standards & sustainable fittings:
,,,,,,"WPP is integrating consideration of environmental standards into its property acquisition process so that where possible any property purchased meets advanced standards such as LEED, BREAM and the Gold Mark Scheme Gold Standard. For example, O&M's Worldwide headquarters in New York, designed and built for LEED certification, has been selected for the Green Building of America Award-winning Project, from 2,500 buildings nominated as part of the ""Real Estate & Construction Review"" magazine's 2009 Green Success Stories."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"In addition, WPP has set up procurement contracts with furniture and carpet suppliers to ensure the products we purchase come from sustainable sources and can be disposed of in a responsible manner."

,,,,,,Flaring and Venting —  Managing the routine flaring and venting of “associated” gas (the natural gas extracted with crude oil during production) is an ongoing challenge for Chevron and other operators in countries having limited infrastructure for delivering natural gas where it can be put to beneficial use.
,,,,,,"For the past seven years, we have been a partner in the World Bank–led Global Gas Flaring Reduction initiative to facilitate flaring reduction. Through the execution of a series of commercial projects to capture and use the gas, and with the cooperation of industry and government partners, we reduced GHG emissions from flaring and"
,,,,,,venting by 8 percent in 2009.
,,,,,,Carbon Dioxide Injection - Chevron has several major natural gas
,,,,,,"investments off the northwestern coast of Australia, including the Gorgon Project, which will include the world’s largest commercial-scale greenhouse gas storage site. The Gorgon Project will position"
,,,,,,"Australia as a leader in the application of greenhouse gas storage, with up to approximately 3.4 million metric tons a year of CO2 being injected and stored underground. Over the life of the project, it is anticipated that approximately 120 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions will have been avoided because of the Gorgon CO2 injection project."
,,,,,,"Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy- In 2009, Chevron decreased the total energy the company needed to complete all of its business functions by 30 percent compared with the energy the company would have used in 1992 to complete equivalent functions. The 2009 cost of energy to the company was approximately $4.7 billion. Total 2009 energy consumption for Chevron’s operated assets was approximately 916 trillion Btu. Fuel combustion is the leading source of GHG emissions from our operations, so increasing our overall energy efficiency signifies a corresponding decrease in carbon emissions."

,,,,,,Set of measures to reduce CO2 emissions in production
,,,,,,Set of measures to reduce electricity used in production
,,,,,,
,,,,,,Improving Fuel Efficiency and Reducing Diesel Exhaust Emissions
,,,,,,"PSA Peugeot Citroën is continuing to optimize conventional internal combustion engines to improve their fuel efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint, by deploying advanced technological solutions in engine architecture, fuel intake systems and injection systems."
,,,,,,"PSA Peugeot Citroën has developed extensive expertise in diesel powertrains, which consume less fuel and emit less CO2 while delivering the same performance as equivalent petrol engines."
,,,,,,"Developed in cooperation with Ford Motor Company, commonrail, direct-injection HDi diesel engines deliver outstanding driving comfort and reduce CO2 emissions by a significant 20% compared with the previous-generation diesels. These benefits have made the HDi one of the best selling engines in Europe, where diesels represented more than 45% of unit sales in 2009. In 2009, the Group unveiled a new 3-litre V6 HDi diesel designed for the Citroën C5 and C6 and the Peugeot 407 Coupé. In compliance with Euro 5 emissions standards, the new engine delivers a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions compared with the 2.7-litre V6 engine it replaced. Some 1.27 million HDi powerplants were produced in 2009, bringing total output to more than 13.7 million units since 1998."
,,,,,,"In 2009, Peugeot introduced the 207 1.6-litre HDi, which emits just 99 g/km of CO2 thanks to a particularly efficient technical package that includes special aerodynamics and optimized engine calibration. Citroën will also bring 99 g/km diesel versions of the DS3 and the new C3 to the European market in the first quarter of 2010."
,,,,,,Improving Fuel Efficiency and Reducing Petrol Exhaust Emissions
,,,,,,"Since 2006, PSA Peugeot Citroën has been offering the 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engines developed jointly with BMW Group, which deliver a 10 to 15% reduction in CO2 emissions compared with their predecessors. By the end of 2009, 1.3 million of these engines had already been produced."
,,,,,,A new stage in the cooperation began in January 2010 with the signature of an agreement to jointly develop the next generation of Euro 6-compliant 4-cylinder petrol engines.
,,,,,,"At the same time, the Group is also working on a new family of 1-litre and 1.2-litre, 3-cylinder petrol engines, which are scheduled for launch in 2012. The new powerplant will make it possible to offer cars that emit less than 100 g of CO2/km without additional technology."
,,,,,,"To curb carbon emissions from its vehicles in China, the Group also plans to bring six new petrol engines to the local market by 2020, starting with the new 2.3-litre VTEC engine debuted on the Citroën C5."
,,,,,,Using Alternative Fuels
,,,,,,"Another way to reduce a vehicle’s carbon footprint is to explore the use of other fuels than petrol and diesel, such as natural gas, LPG and biofuels. The energy efficiency and environmental performance of these alternative fuels vary widely depending on each market’s specific features."
,,,,,,Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
,,,,,,"PSA Peugeot Citroën markets vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) in markets where CNG is already a viable alternative to petrol and diesel, such as China, Iran, Turkey and Argentina. CNG not only helps to reduce tank-to-wheel carbon emissions by 20% compared with petrol, it also enables engines to deliver exceptional fuel efficiency."
,,,,,,"In addition, CNG versions of the Peugeot Partner and Citroën Berlingo light commercial vehicles and the Citroën C3 supermini are already available in a number of European countries (Italy, The Netherlands, France)."
,,,,,,Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)
,,,,,,"Manufactured as a by-product in refineries or extracted from natural gas fields, LPG generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions than petrol (well-to-wheel emissions are on a par with diesel) and emits very little particulate matter. This is why its use is encouraged by tax incentives in certain countries, such as Italy and the Netherlands, which make it a particularly interesting alternative fuel."
,,,,,,"In Italy, Peugeot offers a retrofit LPG kit for the Peugeot 206+, 207 and 207 SW."
,,,,,,Biofuels
,,,,,,"The wider use of biofuels raises a host of social and environmental issues. This is why PSA Peugeot Citroën supports the development of so-called “sustainable” biofuels, which comply with the standards being explored in Europe and globally, for example to avoid the adverse impact of diverting farmland from food to energy crops. According to European Union directive 2009/28/ EC on renewable energies, to be certified as sustainable, biofuels must have a positive environmental, economic and social impact. In particular, they must effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 35% today and by at least 60% in 2018."
,,,,,,Ethanol and Flex-Fuel Vehicles
,,,,,,All of the Group’s petrol-powered models produced since 1 January 2000 can run on SP95-E10 (a blend of regular unleaded petrol (SP95) and 10% plant-derived ethanol).
,,,,,,"PSA Peugeot Citroën has also developed fl ex-fuel engines that can run on ethanol/petrol blends of up to 85% ethanol in Europe (E85) and from 20 to 100% ethanol in Brazil. In the latter country, the  world’s largest market for ethanol and flex-fuel vehicles, the Group markets flex-fuel versions of the Peugeot 206 and the Citroën C3, C4 and Xsara Picasso. In 2009, these vehicles accounted for more than 65% of the petrol vehicles sold by the Group in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay) and close to 85% of those sold in Brazil."
,,,,,,"In addition, flex-fuel versions of the Peugeot 308 and Citroën C4 and C5 were marketed in several European countries in 2009, with the majority sold in Sweden."
,,,,,,Biodiesel
,,,,,,"All of the Group’s diesel vehicles can run on a biodiesel blend of up to 30%, provided that the fuel is of high quality and the vehicle is maintained accordingly (diesel filter, lubricant, etc.)."
,,,,,,"The Group’s service fleet, which totals around 700 vehicles travelling some 14 million kilometres per year, has been running on B30 biodiesel for more than a decade."
,,,,,,Stop & Start System
,,,,,,"Stop & Start technology shuts down the engine automatically when the vehicle is standing still or in neutral – at a red light, for example – and starts it up again instantly and noiselessly when reactivated by the driver. As a result, it helps to reduce carbon emissions by up to 15% in city driving. When combined with the system’s cost-effectiveness, these features make Stop & Start an efficient solution to a number of traffic-related issues in cities, where 75% of Europeans live."
,,,,,,"First-generation Stop & Start technology was introduced on the Citroën C2 and C3 in 2004. The second generation, equipped with a more powerful integrated starter-generator that allows regenerative braking, will be launched in the second half of 2010 and deployed on virtually every Peugeot and Citroën model in Europe in 2011, marketed under the name “e-HDi”. Economies of scale from the forecast volumes will ensure that the system is widely affordable. The Group’s objective is to have sold a total of one million vehicles equipped with Stop & Start technology by the end of 2013."
,,,,,,Investment: €300 million
,,,,,,Number of patents filed: More than 30
,,,,,,Project duration: 36 months
,,,,,,Number of people involved: 500 engineers and technicians
,,,,,,Hybrids
,,,,,,"PSA Peugeot Citroën is actively preparing the deployment of a range of hybrid technologies, combining an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, that will deliver significant improvements in fuel efficiency and carbon emissions (to less than 99 g/km), particularly in city driving."
,,,,,,"PSA Peugeot Citroën’s HYbrid4 diesel hybrid technology represents a major breakthrough in terms of fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions in the European market, offering gains of nearly 35% compared with the equivalent HDi diesel model. The drivetrain combines the high fuel efficiency of the HDi diesel in highway driving with all the benefits of electric propulsion on city and suburban roads. It also offers all-wheel drive capability, thanks to the electric motor mounted on the rear axle assembly, as well as the Stop & Start system and a particulate filter."
,,,,,,"The technology will initially equip distinctive Peugeot and Citroën models, starting with the Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 and the Citroën DS5 HYbrid4 scheduled for market launch in 2011. They are expected to emit just 99 g/km of CO2."
,,,,,,"As part of its strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles sold in China, the Group plans to bring HYbrid4 petrol hybrids to the Chinese market by 2015."
,,,,,,Plug-in Hybrids
,,,,,,"The Group is working on a plug-in hybrid, i.e. an EV that can be recharged almost anywhere from a simple electric socket. An enhanced battery pack will enable the plug-in to run in all-electric mode for between 15 and 50 kilometres, which corresponds to most motorists’ daily needs. It therefore offers all the benefits of an EV for day-to-day use, but can also handle longer distances thanks to its internal combustion engine. Wide-scale testing will be carried out on an initial fleet of around a hundred vehicles starting in 2011, ahead of the technology’s market launch in 2012. The long-term objective is to reduce these plug-ins’ CO2 emissions to less than 50 g/km."
,,,,,,Electric Vehicles
,,,,,,"In late 2010, PSA Peugeot Citroën will introduce two newgeneration city EVs developed in conjunction with Mitsubishi Motors, the Peugeot iOn and the Citroën C-Zero. With a driving range of 130 kilometres, these vehicles are capable of satisfying 90% of motorists’ daily transport needs. PSA Peugeot Citroën aims to ensure that these EVs have similar total cost of ownership to internal combustion engine vehicles. It will also help to set up systems for battery collection, reuse and recycling."
,,,,,,"The Group’s EV line-up will also include two electric commercial vehicles, the Peugeot Partner Origin and Citroën Berlingo First, developed in cooperation with Venturi Automobiles. Designed more specifically for fleet use, their Zebra sodium nickel chloride battery, located under the bonnet, offers a range of 100 kilometres and can be charged from a simple mains socket. 250 of these vehicles have already been ordered under a pilot tender from the French Post Office."
,,,,,,Fuel Cell Vehicles
,,,,,,"Over the longer term, the Group is exploring possible applications of hydrogen fuel cell technology. In December 2009, it presented its Peugeot 307 CC FiSyPAC demonstrator, which is equipped with a range extender and the Genepac fuel cell stack developed jointly with the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). It uses less than one kilogram of hydrogen per 100 kilometres, ranking it among the best-in-class worldwide."
,,,,,,PSA Peugeot Citroën has successfully quadrupled the fuel cell’s lifespan and increased its efficiency by nearly 20% since 2006.
,,,,,,"As a result, process engineering and mass marketing would seem foreseeable as from 2020-2025. However, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are still a long way from the technical and economic maturity needed to support mass-market production. Although considerable progress has been made, hydrogen fuel cell technology must still overcome a number of obstacles, such as the cost of the fuel cell system and the lithium ion batteries, the fuel cell’s lifespan and the deployment of the necessary infrastructure to market hydrogen to the general public."
,,,,,,Equipment
,,,,,,"In addition to working on engines, PSA Peugeot Citroën is improving the overall fuel efficiency of its vehicles by optimizing various vehicle components and equipment:"
,,,,,,"• Equipping certain models with electronic manual gearboxes, which can improve fuel efficiency by up to 5%."
,,,,,,"• Optimizing air-conditioning components, like the evaporator and compressor, to reduce the energy required to run the system, and eventually replacing R134a, the current refrigerant, with new solutions that contribute less to global warming."
,,,,,,"• Selecting tyres that offer the best trade-off between grip (primary safety) and low rolling resistance, given that a 10% reduction in rolling resistance reduces a vehicle’s carbon emissions by an average of 2 g/km. PSA Peugeot Citroën prefers very low rolling resistance (VLRR) tyres and is widely deploying tyre pressure sensors."
,,,,,,"• Equipping certain models, such as the Peugeot 207 and 207 SW and the Citroën C3 and DS3, with a gear change indicator that promotes eco-driving by indicating the best time to upshift."
,,,,,,• Offering an online service record and eco-driving service via Citroën’s e-Touch telematics service.
,,,,,,Vehicle Mass
,,,,,,"Mass has a direct influence on a car’s fuel efficiency, and therefore on its carbon emissions, with a 100 kg reduction in weight delivering a gain of an average 4 g/km. To shrink the environmental footprint of its models, PSA Peugeot Citroën is therefore actively reducing their mass, with the goal of making vehicles in development more than 100 kg lighter than the previous models, while continuing to meet cost and performance specifications, particularly in the area of safety. Teams also pay careful attention in selecting a vehicle’s base materials, starting with the metals that on average account for around 70% of its total weight."
,,,,,,Aerodynamics
,,,,,,"A vehicle’s performance also depends on its aerodynamics. PSA Peugeot Citroën uses wind tunnel testing and digital modelling to reduce a car’s drag area (CdA) without compromising on the other technical, practical, aesthetic and regulatory parameters involved in vehicle design, such as styling, safety, stability, storage space, engine cooling, rainwater drainage and acoustics. A 0.05 m2 reduction in drag area reduces a vehicle’s carbon emissions by 2.5 g/km."
,,,,,,Using Green Materials
,,,,,,"To optimise the use of resources, PSA Peugeot Citroën is focusing much of its research on polymers, since most of the other materials, such as metals and fluids, are already recyclable and extensively recycled. Polymers account for almost 20% of a vehicle’s total mass."
,,,,,,"Since 2008, the Group has deployed an ambitious plan to increase the proportion of green materials, by weight, in a vehicle’s total polymers (excluding tyres) to 20% by 2011 and to 30% by 2015, from an average 6% in 2007. For the Group, green materials include three families of materials: recycled plastics, natural materials (wood, vegetable fibres, etc.) and biomaterials (made from renewable instead of petrochemical feedstocks). Their use offers a number of benefits, such as reducing the use of fossil plastics and fostering the development of plastics recycling processes by increasing demand."
,,,,,,Each vehicle project has a contractual objective for the use of green materials.
,,,,,,"Progress towards fulfilling the green materials plan may be illustrated by the Citroën C3 Picasso, in which green materials make up around 11% of its 170 kg of polymers (excluding tyres)."
,,,,,,"Examples include natural fibres, used to make the rear parcel shelves, boot carpeting and door insets, and recycled automotive plastics, used as raw material for mudguards."
,,,,,,"Green materials represent nearly 20% of the Citroën C3 Picasso e-HDi demonstrator unveiled in early 2010, in such new components as floor mats, seat cushion foam, wheel trims and the fuel tank."
,,,,,,"On the Peugeot 207, rear view mirror support stalks are made of hemp-fibre reinforced polypropylene instead of the traditional fibreglass. A life cycle assessment performed in 2009 by French environmental consulting firm EVEA showed that the new component delivered significant environmental benefits, reducing weight by 4%, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 14% and water use by 43%."
,,,,,,Car manufacturing
,,,,,,"Even if the impacts are lower than the car emissions, PSA has worked for a long time, to make all his plants completely respectful of environmental legal constraints and to lower its contribution to greenhouse effect."
,,,,,,The GHG emission reduction global objective is handled through an energy reduction plan with a view of cutting global costs with a long term view. It lays on :

,,,,,,The Group’s strategy is based on an ambitious energy consumption reduction plan.
,,,,,,The main contributor to the emission reduction is the energy management plan developed in PSA plant for many years. We monitor the effect of this plan on the emission since 1995.
,,,,,,"Managing significant impacts from other sites (R&D, design, administrative, spare parts centers…)"
,,,,,,"In addition to its efforts at production units, the Group has taken measures to reduce the most significant environmental impacts from other sites, including replacement parts facilities, R&D and administrative centres, and the Peugeot and Citroën dealership networks. In 2007, it extended its ISO 14001 certification programme to the Trnava industrial site, the Vesoul replacement parts facility and the La Garenne technical centre. Next up will be the Belchamp centre."
,,,,,,"As part of its environmental programme, PSA Peugeot Citroën has also taken steps to optimise paper use by printing only when necessary and facilitating wastepaper recycling. An action plan has been implemented to develop and deploy an international scorecard of good environmental and social practices in the Peugeot and Citroën networks, notably to manage waste, environmental disturbances and natural resource use more effectively."
,,,,,,"Gefco transportation activities: incentive program called “Challenge Bon Conducteur” (“Good Driver Challenge”). It provides training on eco-driving, thus encourages gas-oil savings and CO2 emission reduction."
,,,,,,Gefco transportation activities: Voluntary commitment of reducing CO2 emissions of our owned-fleet (signed in December 2009).
,,,,,,"Gefco transportation activities: Transport mix is studied to increase the use of more environmentally-friendly transport - river, rail and sea - in its transport plans. Thus, GEFCO has boosted the share of non-road transport up to 25%. Sea transport accounts for 14% of all of the Group's transport purchasing, against an 8% European average for the sector."

,,,,,,
,,,,,,"While we do encourage our travel vendors to improve their own fleet efficiency, the most direct way we can reduce emissions from travel is by reducing travel itself. Based on internal surveys, the most common purposes for business travel are meetings with customers and partners, internal meetings, and events (in our carbon footprint, Autodesk reports emissions from event-related travel separately from regular business travel)."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"To reduce travel to meetings, we have made significant investments in virtual collaboration technologies. These include 18 Telepresence systems, more than 50 Roundtable systems, and a Live Meeting and webcam system that we plan to install on every computer. We are also rolling out extensive training and support programs to encourage employees to capitalize on these tools."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Autodesk also works to maximize remote collaboration at our major events, reducing the effects of travel. In 2009, we added a virtual component to our largest conference, Autodesk University. This allowed more people around the world to access the conference remotely. Read more about our efforts to green our events."

,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Autodesk invests in energy-saving initiatives at our facilities. In 2008-2009, we conducted a comprehensive energy audit of our 13 largest worldwide facilities, and have been using the results to prioritize efficiency retrofits and operational changes at these existing sites."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Our efforts also extend to new facilities. Autodesk targets green buildings during site selection, and employs sustainable features when constructing new workplaces. As a result of our efforts, we have been awarded LEED certifications at 7 of our facilities (2 rated Platinum, 3 Gold, and 2 Certified). We continue to work toward achieving more LEED certifications when opportunities arise."

,,,,,,Obtaining Facilities Data
,,,,,,"Obtaining data about energy use in our facilities is challenging because we lease the majority of our facilities. In buildings where we are a major tenant, we work with the landlords to advocate for transparency of energy consumption. In fiscal year 2010, we successfully captured energy data from 76% of our total facilities square footage. As we continue to partner with landlords and other tenants, we aim to obtain data from an increasingly larger portion of our worldwide facilities."

,,,,,,"Each year, Autodesk hosts several conferences with thousands of attendees and participates in industry trade shows across the globe. These events are important for our business, but leave an impact on the environment in the form of greenhouse gas emissions from travel, energy, and lodging, as well as materials use and waste."
,,,,,,Autodesk has developed sustainability guidelines and best practices for planning an event that requires travel. These guide our staff in evaluating alternatives and making decisions that will reduce the event’s environmental impact. Issues include:
,,,,,,Selecting a venue that demonstrates sustainable practices
,,,,,,Choosing a location that minimizes travel distance
,,,,,,Adding virtual conferencing and online streaming content to maximize the number of attendees who can participate remotely
,,,,,,Reusing and reducing materials and seeking out materials that are eco-friendly
,,,,,,"Reducing waste throughout the process, from registration to signage and onsite waste reduction"
,,,,,,Implementing onsite recycling
,,,,,,Conducting an environmental footprint of major events in collaboration with vendors to track progress
,,,,,,We are especially proud of the following key accomplishments from 2009:
,,,,,,Booth Design and Reuse
,,,,,,"For custom booth development, we effectively reused more than 50% of the previous year’s booth materials. We intend to expand on this achievement again this year, with reuse of nearly 75%."
,,,,,,Eco-Friendly Materials
,,,,,,We increased the percentage of recyclable or biodegradable event materials in our custom booths to 75%.
,,,,,,Reducing Travel
,,,,,,"For the first time, we added a virtual attendance option at our largest annual conference, Autodesk University (AU). This allowed more people around the world to access the event, while reducing physical attendance. Reducing travel significantly lowers the carbon impact of our events; approximately 80% of our events-related emissions are due to air travel. In 2009, overall attendance at AU—including virtual attendance and other online elements—increased by 95% while carbon emissions decreased by 37%."
,,,,,, 
,,,,,,"The Autodesk Events Project Team manages the evaluation, prioritization, and implementation of measures that reduce the environmental impact of our events. The team works in collaboration with key stakeholders across the company."
,,,,,,"To decrease energy use in our data centers, Autodesk uses the Energy Star rating system to select the most efficient data servers, as well as invests in virtualizing servers. Data server virtualization saves energy by reducing the need to run and cool physical servers. So far, Autodesk has virtualized 38% of our servers. Autodesk is a member of The Green Grid, a global consortium of IT companies seeking to improve energy efficiency in business computing systems. In 2009, we contributed to The Greed Grid Technical Committee’s efforts to develop a metric for data center energy efficiency called Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). The Autodesk average PUE at our main vendor’s data center is 1.8."
,,,,,,"Autodesk also works to reduce energy consumption from IT office equipment. Autodesk uses the EPEAT rating system to evaluate, compare, and select desktop hardware based on environmental performance criteria such as energy efficiency, lower use of toxic material, and less waste produced in manufacturing. For example, we have implemented a desktop energy management system that can remotely measure and activate energy efficient power management settings on company-owned computers."
,,,,,,"At the end-of-life phase, Autodesk works with electronic waste (e-waste) service providers to replace and recycle our IT equipment responsibly. We evaluate the practices of our e-waste providers and are implementing a policy to screen and prioritize providers according to their environmental performance."
,,,,,,"While IT uses energy and generates e-waste, it also offers solutions that help reduce our overall environmental impact. Autodesk has made significant investments in virtual collaboration technologies that will reduce travel and improve remote work. These include 18 Telepresence systems and more than 50 Roundtable systems. In addition, our new standard-issue laptop has a camera integrated into the unit to enhance remote collaboration such as virtual meetings and instant messaging. We are also rolling out training and support programs to encourage employees to use these tools."

Improving energy efficiency of the homes we build: This is a high priority for KB Home, both because of its direct link to climate change (85% of the energy consumed during the entire life cycle of a home comes from day-to-day living), and its ability to reduce the cost of homeownership through the potential reduction in utility bills. "
,,,,,,"In 2009, 62% of the homes we built were ENERGY STAR-qualified.  From 2000 through 2009, we built over 64,000 highly energy-efficient homes (ENERGY STAR-qualified homes and ComfortWise certified homes).  According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, each ENERGY STAR-qualified home, when compared to a home built to standard building and energy codes, consumes 15% less energy and reduces GHG emissions by 2.6 metric tons annually.  Accordingly, these homes, in the aggregate, reduce GHG emissions by more than 168,000 metric tons annually when compared to homes built to standard building and energy codes."
,,,,,,"2.  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions of our operations:  Among other steps, we have undertaken the following activities:"
,,,,,, 
,,,,,,• Optimizing Jobsite Construction Scheduling.  We have enhanced our centralized scheduling process to better coordinate the work of third party suppliers and trade labor partners and reduce required travel to and from our jobsites.
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"• Reducing Business-Related Travel.  We have significantly limited the number of in-person company meetings in an effort to reduce the cost of travel, lodging and event expenditures, and to reduce our use of fossil fuel for transporting employees to meetings.  We use a virtual meeting system, branded “KBU iLab.” This in-house technology platform allows all departments and work groups to hold virtual meetings in several online rooms simultaneously, and greatly decreases our travel to meetings and training sessions. In 2009, nearly 2,000 hours of meetings were hosted on KBU iLab."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"• Eliminating Bottled Water.  In 2008, we eliminated company purchases of bottled water and distributed reusable, water bottles to our employees.  We estimate (based on United States Environmental Protection Agency data) that this change in our corporate headquarters alone reduced our carbon footprint by approximately 5.8 metric tons of CO2 annually.  In 2009, over 80% of our offices implemented this standard."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"• Unplugging Display Refrigerators.  Historically, we have displayed in our model homes and KB Home Studios refrigerators that have been plugged in and are operating even though they are not used for food storage.  We now keep display refrigerators and water heaters unplugged.  In addition, refrigerators displayed in our KB Home Studios have their cooling features turned off.  We estimate that unplugging the display refrigerators alone will reduce our annual energy consumption by 297,550 kWh (per the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Residential Refrigerator Savings Calculator for ENERGY STAR-qualified refrigerators), which is equivalent to reducing our carbon footprint by over 200 metric tons of CO2."
,,,,,,
,,,,,,"• Sharing Printers.  Based on a recent computer hardware inventory, we have adopted a goal of removing approximately 50% of our desktop printers from our office environments in 2009."
,,,,,,1. Data Centre Optimisation Program -
,,,,,,"We planned installation of a tri-generation system at our major data centre which enables us to simultaneously produce electricity, heating and cooling using a gas-fired generator. At our smaller data centre, we have upgraded the conventional UPS to a highly efficient model significantly reducing the energy lost between the input and output. In addition, we are undertaking a server virtualisation program to reduce the overall number of servers required, which reduces the cooling requirements, again reducing our energy demand."
,,,,,,2. Application of revised office accommodation design guidelines -
,,,,,,NAB has revised its Design Guidelines for office accommodation to ensure that new or refurbished office accommodation will be designed with the objective of meeting a minimum 4 star Green Star rating (with an objective of a 5 star Green Star rating where financially viable). This means that we are designing our tenancy fit outs with the
,,,,,,"objective of achieving a 4 star National Australian Building Environmental Rating Scheme (NABERS) Energy performance rating, as it is a conditional requirement for obtaining a 4 star Green Star – Office Interiors rating."
,,,,,,3. Retail Branch Efficiency Program -
,,,,,,"Energy Management consultants were contracted to identify and implement energy saving initiatives at our branches. Technical solutions implemented have included air conditioning time control, efficient fluorescent lighting, lighting time controls, smart metering and motion activated control. Other solutions including de-lamping and energy efficient signage were also implemented."
,,,,,,"Over 90% of the NTT Group’s CO2 emissions are attributable to electrical power consumption by offi ces and communications equipment. To reduce our demand for electrical power, we are implementing a groupwide Total Power Revolution (TPR) campaign. Through this campaign, we have been promoting energy management schemes for the 4,000 buildings that our various companies occupy throughout Japan. In addition to deploying energy efficient electrical devices and air conditioning equipment and switching to the use of energy-saving DC power supply* for broadband equipment such as servers and routers, the TPR campaign also calls for the use of clean energy systems such as solar and wind power. These various initiatives resulted in a saving of 150 million kWh of electricity throughout the entire NTT Group in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. We have also launched a Green NTT initiative for promoting the use of renewable energy such as solar power, and we plan to deploy the equivalent of 5 megawatts of solar power systems by fi scal 2013 under a limited liability partnership called NTT-Green LLP."
