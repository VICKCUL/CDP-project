Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"Our global energy management program provides a comprehensive way to pinpoint areas of high energy use, identify opportunities for reduction projects, and share the successes and lessons learned with other facilities. We have also completed energy audits at all our major manufacturing facilities. And, we track energy improvement projects implemented at each site according to the energy and cost savings realized per year. These energy efficiency measures have helped us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. 

Our global energy use decreased by 11% since the baseline year, including an almost 6% decrease in 2009 alone. This is due to energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in our largest facilities in North America and Europe, which have reduced our use of electricity and natural gas, and overall greenhouse gas emissions. We are pleased that electricity use continued to drop in 2009 by 15% over the baseline year. Natural gas consumption also fell, with 2009 use decreasing 11% over 2006, despite company growth."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"Energy efficiency is central to our overall greenhouse gas reduction strategy. We have partnered closely with our utilities to maximize incentives available to help implement many of these projects. Our energy efficiency projects have greatly contributed to our overall reduction in energy use. We are taking many of these best practices to our sites around the world. Millipore implemented a number of energy efficiency measures in 2009, including: HVAC, lighting, motor, and compressed air projects; appliance upgrades; building envelope improvements; and renewable energy installations."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"At the end of 2009, three of our facilities received some of their energy from on-site renewable sources. Our Bedford, Massachusetts research and development facility, Billerica, Massachusetts bioprocess technology center, and Molsheim, France warehouse have state-of-the-art photovoltaic installations. The Bedford solar panels are expected to provide 4% of that facility’s electricity, while the Billerica installation is projected to provide about 7% of that facility’s overall electricity. The Molsheim facility gets 15% of its electricity from its solar installation. Lighting optimization projects have further reduced electricity consumption at these facilities."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"We design and renovate our lab, office and manufacturing spaces to reduce energy use, improve indoor air quality and minimize other environmental impacts. We have followed green building principles at new facilities in St. Charles, Missouri; Danvers, Massachusetts; and Molsheim, France. Our St. Charles lab renovation project received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certification in early 2010, as did our Danvers Mobius® manufacturing site, which received LEED Gold certification. Similar projects include a major renovation of the Bioprocess Worldwide Research & Development Center in Bedford, Massachusetts, and our warehouse facility in Molsheim, France, which was designed according to the French green building standard, Haute Qualité Environnementale."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"The dedication and involvement of our employees is integral to our continued sustainability performance improvement. Company-wide, we emphasize the importance of taking action for sustainability both at home and at work. We have a global energy network team and employee sustainability teams for each of our major manufacturing facilities, as well as some smaller locations. Some of these teams focus on sustainability awareness, while others, such as the regional energy team in the northeastern U.S., are devising creative solutions to conserve energy. We area also engaging employees through visible initiatives in their work spaces. In 2009, we installed 1,100 motion-controlled power strips in cubicles and other work spaces, reducing the plug load demand in our New England facilities by 396 gigajoules per year. Our 2010 plans call for identifying an energy ambassador at all major sites to identify and help implement energy efficiency improvements. We also plan to establish sustainability champions to drive awareness, identify new opportunities to embed sustainability in our products and services, and foster operational improvements. Also we are training staff to serve as energy auditors. to date, we have trained 53 staff members globally."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"Our fleet of company cars, mostly for our sales force, is the source of our mobile GHG emissions, and in 2009, we continued replacing our traditional gas engine U.S. vehicle fleet with more fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrids. At the end of 2009, hybrid vehicles still comprised 30% of our fleet. In Europe, almost all of our fleet is powered by fuel-efficient, smaller output diesel engines. We also have four vehicles that are using biodiesel, an alternative fuel to traditional gasoline or diesel, and one that is using compressed natural gas (CNG)."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"Our worldwide greenhouse gas and energy reduction plan emphasizes proactive steps such as energy efficiency measures, process engineering improvements, green building design, fuel efficiency, and on-site generation, as well as the purchase of renewable energy. While our local power providers do not always include renewable energy in their mix of delivery, we are able to purchase Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) as a method to support development of wind energy, which is one element of our overall climate change strategy.  In 2009, we purchased Green-e certified RECs worth approximately 13,476 MWh (equal to 48,500 gigajoules) from the Tatanka Wind Farm in North and South Dakota. This offsets 100% of the electricity used by four of our U.S. manufacturing facilities and our Corporate Headquarters, or 14% of our total electricity use worldwide."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"Some process emissions from our manufacturing activities pose a particular challenge for us due to their greater global warming potential. Between 2008 and 2009, we experienced a 15% increase in some of these emissions as a result of increased demand for our products used to produce vaccine and cancer treatments. No suitable substitute has yet been found for these gases, which are essential in product safety testing. While we were disappointed by the 2009 process emissions, we welcome the opportunity for improvement. We are currently working on an alternative process for testing our products, but we must ensure that any change results in products of equal or better quality and safety. We have already optimized our manufacturing process to reduce use of these gases, and in the short-term, are looking at methods to offset the emissions we cannot abate. Over the long term, we are working on an engineering solution we hope will eliminate our use of these gases altogether. And, we continue to seek opportunities to eliminate or reduce GHG emissions at our major manufacturing facilities. We remain committed to meeting our 20% GHG reduction target even as our business continues to grow."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"In Cork, Ireland, we installed a wind turbine. Though this system provides minimal energy generation, it nevertheless represents an important first step in producing more renewable energy on-site."
Millipore Corp.,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"In 2009, we implemented two projects to reduce energy consumption associated with heating, both at our Molsheim, France facility. By recovering previously lost heat from air compressors, we were able to save 281 gigajoules (78,000 kWh) of energy per year in Molsheim."

TUI AG,Germany,Public,Germany 200,,Long,"TUI Airlines have set the target to reduce the carbon emissions by 6% till 2013/14 (basis: 2007/08). In October 2009 TUI Airlines have already received a reduction of 2,5%.

TUI Airlines have a set of over 30 measure in order to reduce their carbon emissions. This include e.g the continuous renewal of old aircraft with new ones, the installation of winglets or regular engine water wash of the turbines. Moreover TUI Travel is a member of SAFUG (Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group). Therefore, TUI Airlines are involved in testing biofuel whether this fuel is usable and appropriate. 

Our customer are able to compensate their booked flight. In cooperation with several independent offsetting companies (myclimate, World Care Fund, etc.) the donations will be used to support projects reducing emissions. Customers of the German Airline TUIfly donated over 660,00 Euro within the first  two years. This lead to a carbon saving of 33,000 tonnes."
TUI AG,Germany,Public,Germany 200,,Long,"The brands managed by TUI Hotel & Resorts are
among the pioneers of local environment action, whatever
the location. Broad support and advice from Environmental
Management in the headquarters and the environment
officers designated within each hotel company ensure
an active approach to environmental management and
make an important contribution to quality, appeal and
sustainable development in our holiday destinations.
Uniting ten hotel brands, TUI Hotels & Resorts considers environmental management as a crucial aspect for environmental protection (including cliamte protection), sustainability and quality. For that reason, several hotels of TUI Hotels & Resorts have conducted measures to reduce their carbon footprint. Certain examples of measures and the savings will be stated in the following:

Example: About 90 % of Morocco’s energy is imported because
the country has hardly any fossil deposits. As energy
demand has also been rising steadily in recent years,
the development of sustainable energy conversion has
been proceeding apace. The ROBINSON Club in Agadir
has taken advantage of the many days of sunshine
during the year and entered into a partnership with a
specialist company to build the biggest solar facility in
the country. The solar panels are installed on the Club
roofs. They have a surface area of over 900 m² and a
capacity of 2,600 kWh/day. The heat is used for the hot
water supply and to keep the pool complex warm. The
facility has been such a success that similar projects
are now being designed for companies and hotels in
the area."
TUI AG,Germany,Public,Germany 200,,Long,"The ROBINSON Club Amadé at Kleinarl (Austria) obtains
heat from a carbon-neutral biomass plant which
uses the latest condensing technology, set up in spring
2004 by a partnership involving the Club investors, local
farmers and the energy companies Nahwärme GmbH
and AESG. Nearby farmers supply the fuel in the form
of forest chippings – a self-regenerating commodity.
Having such a large client enabled Nahwärme Kleinarl
to provide district heating to the entire village centre:
many local residents are also supplied by the power
station. The Club was able to avoid the expense of an
oil-fired heating system and 100 % of its heating and
hot water is provided by the biomass plant. The facility
has saved about 800,000 litres of heating oil per
annum."
TUI AG,Germany,Public,Germany 200,,Long,"The hotel brand RIU has consistently pursued energy saving
measures for more than ten years, thereby
helping to protect the climate. In RIU hotels lamp bulbs
are progressively being replaced by low-energy bulbs
and LED lighting. That cuts carbon emissions by nearly
7,500 tonnes. Power consumption is also being reduced
by using energy-efficient domestic appliances and
screens, and smart controls have been installed to
manage heating and air conditioning."
TUI AG,Germany,Public,Germany 200,,Long,"Due to particle enter the engine during flight, the fuel consumption slightly increases over time. In order to avoid this increasing fuel consumption, TUI washes the engines of the airplanes regularly. Taking only the aircraft type B737 into account, engine water wash leads to a reduction of 7,200 tonnes of CO2 per year."
TUI AG,Germany,Public,Germany 200,,Long,"TUI’s cruise operators have introduced various measures
to protect ecosystems, maritime biodiversity and
the climate. The vessels operated by Hapag-Lloyd
Kreuzfahrten and TUI Cruises are equipped with state-of-
the-art environment technology. In the Arctic and
Antarctic, cruise liners use diesel rather than heavy oil,
and they are encouraged to use diesel in other waters,
too. As a member of the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) and the Association
of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO), Hapag-
Lloyd Kreuzfahrten observes their environment guidelines
on all Arctic and Antarctic voyages, thereby actively
showing respect for the environment and climate
in these sensitive regions. The cruise liners conduct additional measures like reduction of speed in order to decrease emissions disproportionately."
TUI AG,Germany,Public,Germany 200,,Long,"The 700 or so retail outlets within the
German TUI travel agency structure receive their electricity
from NaturEnergie AG. The annual supply of
about 10 million kilowatt-hours corresponds to the annual
power consumption of 3,000 households. Generating
this volume from hydroelectricity saves almost
6,000 tonnes of CO2. Most branches of TUI Nordic and
230 First Choice travel agents in the United Kingdom
buy “green” power from renewable energy sources."
TUI AG,Germany,Public,Germany 200,,Long,"Members of staff suggested introducing
business bikes for fast, healthy and environment-
friendly travel between TUI premises in Hanover.
Following Board support, eight TUI companies took
part from the start in acquiring the bicycles, which are
available to borrow at four locations. Even in winter
months staff make frequent use of the TUI bikes. That
has saved about 3 tonnes of carbon emissions since the
project was launched. The bikes have proven so popular
and successful that TUI AG backed the “Bike Fit to
Work” project organised by B.A.U.M., a national campaign
for environmentally-aware management."

TransCanada Corporation,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Bonds 180; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"TransCanada’s strategy for managing the GHG emissions from its facilities includes the following activities:
 
Energy Efficiency Programs:

For more than a decade, TransCanada has managed energy efficiency on a company-wide basis. We’ve reduced pipeline energy consumption by installing new, high-efficiency compressors and turbines when adding or replacing equipment. 

In our power business, our wholly owned plants are often built to conserve energy, using cogeneration, combined cycle operation and waste heat recovery to maximize electrical output and minimize fuel consumption. We have also expanded into wind, nuclear and hydro power generation in response to market demand for low emissions electricity."
TransCanada Corporation,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Bonds 180; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"TransCanada’s ongoing commitment to improvements in energy and system efficiencies is demonstrated by our partnership with Rolls Royce to conduct turbine performance trials at the Nordegg Compressor Station. These trials indicate that the RB 211-6761 turbine can deliver up to a nine per cent reduction in fuel consumption and GHG emissions compared with earlier models. Previous generation turbines delivered thermal efficiencies of 35 per cent while the unit at Nordegg achieves 39 per cent efficiency and slightly better than 95 per cent operational availability. As the search for new natural gas resources reaches into the remote frontiers, pipelines span greater distances. Operational efficiency becomes essential in holding down energy costs and limiting greenhouse gas emissions produced by the transmission facilities."
TransCanada Corporation,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Bonds 180; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"Methane Reduction Programs:

Methane which is the largest component of natural gas is also a potent greenhouse gas. Programs that minimize or eliminate methane losses result in a net environmental benefit. TransCanada’s programs to limit methane emissions include the following:

Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) – TransCanada has rigorously managed fugitive emissions from its Canadian pipeline system over the past decade. Fugitive emissions are typically low-level leaks from above ground pipeline and equipment sources, that in total and in time, may add up to significant volumes. The LDAR program involves identifying leaks on pipeline and compressor station components, such as valves, flanges and fittings, setting priorities and conducting repairs. As part of this system-wide effort, TransCanada has been influential in the development and implementation of leak detection technologies."
TransCanada Corporation,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Bonds 180; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"Methane Reduction Programs:

Outage Decision Model (OMD) – The Outage Decision Model (ODM) plays a significant role in minimizing the number of methane releases (blowdowns) required when pipelines are shut down for repairs or new connections. The company has used the ODM to determine when blowdowns are necessary and to combine multiple repair projects into a single blowdown wherever feasible in Canada. In these situations, TransCanada routinely uses truck-mounted portable compressors to transfer gas from affected pipeline sections to adjoining or parallel pipeline sections, greatly reducing the amount of methane releases to the atmosphere."
TransCanada Corporation,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Bonds 180; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"TransCanada continues to invest in zero emitting power generation. As discussed further in section 6.1, the Cartier and Kibby wind farms continue to develop and expand. The Cartier farm has completed three of five wind farms throughout Quebec’s Gaspe Peninsula communities. In addition, the Kibby wind farm in Maine began operation of twenty-two of 44 turbines in 2009."
TransCanada Corporation,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Bonds 180; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"TransCanada assesses new technologies and processes to improve energy efficiency or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One such program is the ongoing testing of the supersonic ejector which captures methane emission from dry gas seals. As a result of previous testing, TransCanada patented this technology. Captured methane is added to the fuel gas required to drive the turbines. This process builds on early dry gas seal technology pioneered by TransCanada that improved the efficiency of the seal, reducing fugitive emissions, as well as eliminating oil and grease spills. An agreement has been reached with a major compressor manufacturer to commercialize and market this technology, and a new prototype is being tested to ensure safe and reliable operation."

FERROVIAL,Spain,Public,Spain 85,Euro 300,Long,"In order to reduce GHG emissions from the accessibility to airports, a Personal Mobility Initiative, involving passengers and users of airports facilities, has been developed in several BAA airports.
The Mobility Strategy involves a series of measures to increase awareness of other modes of transport to reduce access traffic and improve efficiency:
- Improvements in connectivity and interchanges.
- Improvements in public transport alternatives.
- Road management, improvement in the management of access roads.
- Parking. 
- Discounts for staff (over 30%) in transport by bus and train out of London and up to 50% discount on trains between Paddington and Reading stations.
- Car pool: This initiative is a popular choice among employees and is already used by over 6,400 users, 63% of them regularly share rides."
FERROVIAL,Spain,Public,Spain 85,Euro 300,Long,"Other initiatives at the Eastern Campus in Heathrow, as for example the new East Terminal (T2A), one of the main development projects in the next years, has been designed to reduce considerably CO2 emissions (by 40% below the state-of-the-art) using the best available technologies. It is based on:

1) Design phase. (Be lean):
- Control the presence of natural light to cut back on artificial lighting needs
- Provide good winter insulation to minimize heating costs and avoid the accumulation of sunshine in summer to cut back on air conditioning
- Use of awnings to avoid heating by solar radiation and excessive sunlight
- Reduce water consumption in air conditioning by using an aquifer to supply water and taking advantage of its natural cooling properties. This would cut back on both energy and water use for air conditioning.
- Reuse ventilation heat using exchanges that transfer the heat generated inside buildings to the ventilation systems in order to minimize emissions produced by heating equipment.

2) Generating and consuming clean energy produced at the airport (Be clean):
- Generate energy from biomass in a gasification plant that generates gas from biomass waste collected at Heathrow Airport.
- Produce photovoltaic energy using solar panels on the terminal’s roof.
- Reuse wastewater for sanitation and air conditioning.

3) Using clean energy sources (Be green): 
- Use renewable energy sources (suchas wind turbines).
- Plan to install more photovoltaic panels in the future."

- Company cars. Our commitment goes even further and aims to reduce the average CO2 emissions. Through the ECO2nomy Driving initiative, employees are instructed in efficient driving techniques.
Currently, cars supplied by the company are equipped with at least high efficiency Euro 4 standard engines with a capacity of less than 2,500 cc. and all less than six years old.
- Amey provides its contractors with a fleet of cars to carry out their activities, allowing them to choose among diesel fuel, hybrid or LPG.
- MODEC electric vehicles: The features offered by the MODEC model are excellent, zero CO2 emissions, local manufacture and it is 95% recyclable at the end of its useful life. It has received an award for Innovation in the EST Fleet (Energy Saving Trust).
- Research and testing of the latest models of Hydrogen and Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles: Natural Gas although they do emit greenhouse gases, they significantly reduce the particles emitted into the atmosphere and are less dangerous if a leak occurs. 

3) Training in ""green driving"" for employees who travel long distances by car and campaigns to raise awareness amongst employees on effective driving practice.
4) Campaigns to raise awareness amongst employees on:
- effective driving practice
 - reducing  waste generated at work and in personal lives
- tackling climate change

1) Videoconference. Cespa has replacing trips with video and teleconferences, using less contaminating modes of transportation, etc.
2) Mobility Plan:
- In 2008, Ferrovial introduced a Mobility Plan to improve the efficiency of personal modes of transportation used by its employees, suppliers and customers. The project, as part of larger efforts to fight climate change, will gradually gain momentum in collaboration with the Mobility Foundation created by the Municipal Government of Madrid. At the first stage, the main goals will be to reduce commutes to work in private vehicles by providing alternative modes of transportation and we have developed a pilot project capable of verifying the validity of the method agreed upon by both parties.  We have developed a web networking application for those employees interested in a car share on the way to work. There are parking spaces reserved for carpools.  Similarly, CESPA recognizes that a bicycle is a valid means of transportation for trips on a reasonable distance. Therefore, the company made available to employees who decide to cycle to work areas reserved for parking during the working hours.
- Cespa is going to increase the number of company vehicles that run on alternative fuels.
- Cespa provide training sessions to promote fuel efficient driving and/or launch an awareness campaign aimed at reducing consumption.
- Cespa, to reduce CO2 emissions asociates with the movement of personnel of the Quality and Environment Department has enhanced the use of videoconferencing and telephone follow-up of Quality & Environment management System that have replaced some of the visits to business centers.
- With the aim of raising employees’ awareness about the importance of eco-efficiency measures in the management of operations a campaign under the slogan ""Cespa in Action against climate change"" has been prepared. Within the campaign, various news, advices, etc were collected and distributed, contributing to reduction of direct and indirect greenhouse gases and saving natural resources.
- Cespa is working on the project ""SRF"" that consists in producing a quality fuel from waste.
- Cespa is working on the Bioethanol Project, developing a new comprehensive process of waste treatment, generating liquid biofuels as a final result."

In 2009, an energy audit was performed at the main offices of the Corporation to identify potential energy saving opportunities.
The energy audit is an analysis of the situation of a building that provides information on the methods used to operate the building, the level of energy use, the functioning of power systems and facilities and the state of the components, the energy consumed thereby and the associated costs. 
. The audit includes the collection of data on energy-consuming equipment for heating and air conditioning, lighting, ventilation and the other most significant equipment of the building, analyzing them and making recommendations for improvements to reduce energy consumption, while always maintaining appropriate levels of comfort and wellness within the buildings.
The establishment of the measures to implement not only takes into account the technologies and equipment that can be used in each case, but also those behaviors that promote better use of the facilities and equipment, actively involving the personnel in the building.

Various energy-saving measures were initiated in 2009, such as the optimization of operations at the DPC, adjustment of operating hours for heating, air conditioning and lighting, adjustment of temperatures, etc. to better conform to the real needs of the building, which has resulted in a savings of 47.75%.

In 2010 and 2011 we will implement other measures that will result in savings of 15% over 2009 levels. These measures include changes in the installation of lighting (electronic ballasts, energy saving lamps, motion detectors, control systems...)."

Clorox Company,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"Clorox’s GHG reduction plan is focused on four key areas:
1.Reducing the energy use of manufacturing operations 
2.Improving the efficiency of product distribution 
3.Driving for product and package material reduction and improvements 
4.Executing other workplace efficiency initiatives

1. Energy reduction:
Clorox is currently focused on reducing electricity use by retrofitting all North American manufacturing and distribution facilities with energy efficient T5/T8 lighting, and by installation of motion sensors where appropriate. Clorox has also begun to conduct extensive energy audits at manufacturing plants in order to identify other operating equipment and HVAC systems efficiencies that can further reduce electricity use.

2. Distribution efficiency:
Clorox has recently increased the eco-efficiency of finished product distribution markedly by moving from truck to more efficient inter-modal rail. Today, Clorox has over 30 percent of its finished goods distribution miles on inter-modal rail. Distribution network reconfiguration and use of EPA Smart Way carriers are also part of the plan to reduce Clorox’s distribution footprint.

3. Material efficiency:
Clorox is committed to redesigning products and packaging in order to improve the environmental footprint by either reducing or improving the materials used. During the past five years, Clorox has made sustainability improvements to 32 percent* of its product portfolio (volume sold basis) and has plans in place to make sustainability improvements to 25 percent of the portfolio by 2013. And Clorox is proud that 90 percent of product cartons use 100 percent recycled material, and that more than 85 percent of the packages that house the products are recyclable.
(* Per internal Clorox sustainability improvement measurement system) 

4. Workplace Initiatives:
Clorox is also committed to reducing workplace energy use and commensurate GHG emissions.  Clorox has recently reduced business travel by 20 percent, and converted all company cars to Toyota Prius hybrids which reduced fuel use by almost half and reduced annual GHG emissions by about 700 metric tons. Current efforts are focused on making the General Office building more eco-efficient to work towards LEED certification for this key facility."

Cliffs Natural Resources Inc,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"The Green Production Project at United Taconite epitomizes the power of partnering for environmentally sustainable decision making. In 2008, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) was working hard to incorporate regional haze solutions into its air quality plans. A traditional approach to reducing regional haze emissions at United Taconite would likely have included pollution controls that might not be considered economically feasible in most applications and would provide limited emission reduction opportunity. Faced with this realization, Cliffs and MPCA representatives partnered to find a way to redesign the facility in Forbes, Minnesota, that would provide greater emission reductions.
Cliffs committed to make substantial capital improvements to the facility, including a retrofit to allow burning of lower-emitting fuels and the addition of new emission control equipment. The project will allow enhanced fuel blending and the use of lower-sulfur coal and biomass, resulting in substantially less use of petroleum coke and natural gas. The estimated environmental improvements from the Green Production Project are substantial: for each ton of iron pellets produced, there could be a 14% reduction in mercury emissions, 30% reduction in GHG emissions and 37% reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. These reductions will allow the facility to increase production from approximately 5.3 million tons to 6 million tons per year, adding 24 new jobs, while still reducing annual air emissions and helping MPCA address the state’s regional haze issue."
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"Cliffs’ North American underground coal mining facilities in West Virginia and Alabama have been recovering coal mine methane for several years. As a voluntary participant on the Chicago Climate Exchange, Cliffs’ coal facilities have captured over 3.5 million cubic feet of coal mine methane as qualified early emission reductions from 2003 to 2006 (and substantially more prior to the qualifying period from 1999 to 2003). With extremely efficient surface-drilled multilateral wells, up to 90% of coal mine methane can be recovered and sold – substantially reducing the amount of methane subsequently released during mining and conserving a local source of valuable, clean-burning energy."
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"Mercury emissions also result from iron ore processing. Cliffs’ Minnesota operations have joined in a cooperative state-federal-industry research project to investigate possible means of reducing furnace emissions to address national and state concerns about mercury emissions from combustion sources. As part of this project, Cliffs and the other taconite mining companies in Minnesota have agreed to a voluntary 75% reduction by 2050 industry-wide, based on the 2010 Minnesota Mercury Emission Inventory taconite emission level of 841 pounds per year. If successful, this would result in a total reduction of 631 pounds per year (due to the variability of the quantity of mercury contained in each ore body, we currently cannot accurately measure the quantity of mercury emitted and must rely on estimations)."
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc,USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"The most significant emissions at Cliffs’ facilities contributing to regional haze are nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from process emissions and fugitive dust. As discussed in prior sections, Cliffs is actively pursuing ways to reduce process emissions –
With respect to fugitive emissions, dust from stockpiling and moving material can impact air quality and visibility. Each of our operations has comprehensive measures in place to control fugitive dust. These include daily inspections of fugitive emission sources, use of watering or foam dust control systems and other practices to minimize dust emissions. We have implemented specific practice and control measures for drilling, blasting, loading/unloading materials, unpaved roads, stockpiles, material transfer points, tailings basins and cleaning activities. When attention is required, corrective actions may include application of water or dust suppressants to roadways, mulching on basin beaches, addition of water to belt transfers or even reduction of material throughput."

VERBUND AG,Austria,Public,Electric Utilities 250,Euro 300,Long,"Solar Home Solution for private electricity customers
In mid 2009, VERBUND launched a Solar Home Bundle composed of a PV system, layout and construction, financing and an attractive refund for excess electricity fed into the grid. 
The realisation of the project resulted in the foundation of the company „Solarverbund GmbH“ (http://www.solarverbund.at/), a professional partner of VERBUND.
During daytime the PV system produces electricity which is directly consumed by electrical devices in the household. Consequently, no electricity has to be procured from the grid, thus reducing costs for electricity, net fees, taxes and charges. Excess electricity is fed into the grid and contracted (and reimbursed) by VERBUND, generating another income stream for the owner of the PV system (feed-in tariffs for PV are not available for all applicants in Austria).
This project was a voluntary investment in order to increase the rate of private customers using new renewables and to develop the decentralised electricity production all over Austria.
Our service caused a growing demand: more than 3,000 requests and 500 submitted applications for government aid. By now, and according to plan, about 100 plants have been sold from January
2009 until December. Because of increased subsidies in 2010 this

If this electric energy was purchased according to the so called marginal principle it can be anticipated that the energy will be produced by fossil fuels (oil, coal). If such a scenario is applied the emissions per kWh is 1000 g of fossil carbon dioxide. The installation of the recovery boiler will thus result in lower emissions of fossil carbon dioxide by 250 000 tonnes."

The temperature in refrigerated display cases was more consistent and safer, and the staff found the work environment more comfortable.
The investments done in stores, e.g. lids and doors on refrigerators and freezers, has a pay-back time on approximately two years. The investment of 300 000 Swedish krona for a medium sized store gives quite fast return on investment."
Hakon Invest AB,Sweden,Public,Nordic 200,,Long,"In Norwegian stores, ICA uses the CoolICA system, which monitors energy consumption and temperatures.

It facilitates an easy follow up and aims at creating awareness for energy savings among the store staff. The investments on measuring equipment in stores for larger stores and if calculated on an energy saving of 10% this investment will pay back in a few months. Consequently, many investments on energy efficiency in stores could be made without too much risk.

Moreover, the project has facilitated a valuable transfer of experience between suppliers and with ICA and KRAV. As of 2010, all suppliers use green electricity in their production and all of them have or will conduct an energy analysis and set goals to reduce energy consumption. These companies have become increasingly aware of environmental issues, including climate change, which is leading to a steady flow of new ideas for improvements.

As a landlord, we constantly review our environmental performance, putting various initiatives in place for areas such as efficient use of energy and water as well as recycling practices. These include use of motion sensors to activate the lights in common leased areas, the use of energy-efficient lighting, the efficient use of airconditioning chillers and even AHU equipped with variable speed drives. The data in all three areas are closely monitored every month and compared against KPIs set for each property. 

As landlord, CDL also assists in monitoring the electricity bills of its occupiers. If there are fluctuations of more than 10%, the building management will duly investigate the cause of the increase.

In 2007, CDL pioneered a green initiative to raise the air-conditioning temperature control by 1 degree celcius. Today, CDL’s “1°C Up Campaign” has been successfully expanded to 13 CDL buildings from the pilot launched of  five  buildings in 2007."

Given the amount of energy consumed by its buildings and IT systems, they are a focal point for the Group whose priorities are to:
-	set up new and much more precise measurement and reporting tools that will not only enable it to better identify where fluid consumption (energy, water) levels are highest, but also to manage incidents more effectively. The implementation and use of these measurement and reporting resources in the Group's offices and branches is currently under review as part of Société Générale's Green-IT programme (see section on ""smart buildings"" below);

-	build or renovate its buildings (offices and branches) to make them far more energy efficient (see Société Générale's first ""positive energy"" branch in Polynesia). 
The Group wide application of its Responsible Buildings Reference Framework (RBR) and its diagnostics tool will ensure that renovations do concretely mean an improvement in a structure's environmental performance, and work on the concept of an eco-branch is also underway;

-	in technical terms, improve a structure's energy performance by: upgrading current workspaces with new, more efficient equipment, replacing lights with energy-saving fittings, information campaigns to heighten awareness amongst employees of what they can do to help, the introduction of best practices and energy audits of premises to assess what corrective measures to apply where there is a problem of excess consumption, etc.

Societe Generale,France,Public,France 250,Global 500; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"Business travel:
Above and beyond the various information campaigns already in place, Société Générale has introduced a number of transverse measures to optimise business travel within its business lines. These include:
-	a new policy applying to business travel in France and the use of trains and airplanes;
-	its New Car Policy, where the aim is to prioritise vehicles with much lower emission levels in the catalogues of its long-term leasing business
-	the Group's Green-IT programme which involves the development of alternative means of communications like telepresence services, the improvement of video-conferencing systems thanks to a concierge service and new teamwork tools such as instant messaging or webconferencing 
-	more specific measures to heighten employee awareness like the tool which calculates the CO2 emissions their trip will cost when they book over the Group intranet.

In 2009, the first indicators linked to travel to-and-from work and the use of video-conferencing were set in place throughout the Group, with the exception of its Retail Banking business and corporate center departments in France. As they are still in their test phases, their results only allow for a partial analysis. However, it is possible to establish that, within those entities that took part in the test and that account for 14% of the Group's payroll, an average 53% of occupants use public transport when travelling to-and-from work. Second, within those entities that replied regarding the use of video-conferencing and that account for 28% of Group employees (excluding Rosbank), 50,545 hours of video-conferencing were declared, i.e. 1 hour 20 minutes per occupant."

When it comes to paper consumption, Société Générale has two objectives: to reduce consumption and prioritise the use of recycled paper. 
At present, the measures taken by the Group are mostly linked to transverse projects and mean technical changes such as:
-	the replacement of its printers with machines that are systematically configured to only allow doubled-sided printing;
-	the reduction in the number of general and individual printers (the target for the corporate center buildings is 1 printer for 10 members of staff);
-	the use of external service providers (page printing service in the Granite tower for example).

Changes have also been made to the Group's ""institutional"" publications (daily reports, in-house magazines, miscellaneous documents, etc.) which are distributed across the board to each of its business lines and functions, with Société Générale's ongoing efforts to replace paper with electronic formats, optimise the use of printed documents and increase the use of recycled paper helping to reduce its overall impact on the environment. In France, the obligatory use of a central service provider for the Group's paper supply, campaigns to heighten awareness, and even better, directives from its management ensures the increasing use of paper that has been recycled or manufactured according to eco-label standards (paper provided in the Granite tower is recycled paper only)."

Objective: keep the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the buildings to a strict minimum.
Priorities for 2010: apply Société Générale's Responsible Buildings Reference Framework (RBR) to all building construction and renovation projects, and continue to improve energy consumption in the Group's different buildings.
Highlights in 2009: 
-	opening of the Granite tower which has been built according to High Environmental Quality standards (HQE);
-	Société Générale's Head of Real Estate elected ""Real Estate Director of the Year"" for the whole of France in 2009;
-	drafting of the Group's Responsible Buildings Reference Framework;
-	signing of the WBCSD Manifesto for Energy Efficiency in Buildings.

When it comes to buildings, the choice of construction methods and materials must comply with applicable environmental and health and safety standards in order to minimise any impact on the environment, but without for as much compromising the comfort and quality of life of their occupants.

Société Générale's Granite tower clearly reflects the Group's goal to develop more environmentally-friendly buildings. The bank's new office tower in La Défense (Paris) was inaugurated on December 15, 2008, a few days after it won the Grand Prix de l'immeuble neuf (Best New Building Award) for the year awarded by the jury of the SIMI (Salon de l'Immobilier d'entreprise - corporate property trade fair) whose members include real estate directors from France's leading corporations. Société Générale's Granite tower is the first high-rise building in France to be HQE certified. In December 2009, Jean-Marc Castaignon, Real Estate Director for Société Générale, was also named Real Estate Director of the Year by the same jury in recognition of his work and the work of his teams.
A number of best practices to optimise energy consumption are already in place within Société Générale's different buildings and real estate. In June 2008, a working group was set up to examine and define a Responsible Buildings Reference Framework specific to Société Générale to be integrated within the Group's real estate policy, so as to give its real estate managers a single, coherent and practical reference tool. ..."
Societe Generale,France,Public,France 250,Global 500; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"Responsible Real Estate"" Project (2/2)
...The purpose of this reference framework is to create a shared, coherent culture of responsible building management for all Group entities worldwide, and to constantly find new ways to limit energy consumption. Issued at the end of 2009, the framework comes with its own diagnostics tool.

In line with the Group's environmental policy and Carbon Neutrality Project, Société Générale's business lines have embarked on a series of construction and renovation projects to improve the environmental and energy performance of their buildings. Crédit du Nord has refurbished its main branch at Saint Lazare with a ""vertical garden"" that acts as a natural filter to improve the quality of the air within its premises. In the same way, the Group's Real Estate Department has made technical improvements to the head office buildings in order to limit their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as contributing to technical documentation on the best practices that apply within the Group. The Group's French Retail Banking division is working on a prototype for a new eco-branch, whilst the building renovations policy of its Retail Banking Outside France business arm is firmly focused on improving the energy efficiency of its branches and the use of renewable energies.

Backed by these initiatives, Société Générale Group has signed the Manifesto for Energy Efficiency in Buildings of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) which imposes a certain number of obligations and constraints.

Measures are in place to encourage the eco-friendly behaviour of staff, particularly when it comes to consumables, sorting waste and water and electricity consumption. Each member of staff is systematically given a welcome pack when they are relocated to the Granite tower or move to a new office. The aim is to ensure each individual takes responsibility for their own environmental footprint. Throughout the year, articles and messages on ""eco-gestures"" are published on the Group's intranets and on posters and leaflets: ""réflexe off"", sorting waste, ""sustainable printing"", etc."
Societe Generale,France,Public,France 250,Global 500; Euro 300; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"Green IT Project (1/2)
In 2009, the Group consumed close to 824 GWh of electricity and heating and employee travel amounted to approximately 444 million km. The Group also generated the equivalent of around 279,000 tons of CO2 (-4.5% per occupant on 2008). IT systems and equipment accounted for a substantial proportion of these figures, namely close to 50% of the Group's electricity consumption and 25% of its CO2 emissions.

Launched in the summer of 2008, a review of the environmental maturity of SG's IT systems and equipment revealed the Group's strengths and weaknesses according to five major categories of analysis: 
- IT production centers: calculation and data storage infrastructures.
- Working environment of end users: office workstations and laptops, printers, telephone systems, etc.
- Working methods: organisation of work and use of IT systems and equipment potential.
- Purchasing: maturity of suppliers, responsible processes, contractual framework, etc.
- Corporate responsibility: interaction between the company and its ""environment"".

A 20-point plan of action across the five categories selected was then drawn up in order to improve the energy efficiency of the Group's IT resources and reduce its CO2 emissions.

The aim of SG's Green-IT programme is to implement the plan of action resulting from the Group's IT systems' maturity analysis in 2008 by defining the priority measures to be taken in order to meet its ambitious environmental targets.
Its governance has been adapted to ensure the implication of all of the Group's business lines and divisions and oversee their coordination. Working groups have been formed for each of the measures to be set in place and are managed by five programme leaders. The programme itself is supervised by a Green-IT Committee made up of the heads of the main departments concerned (information systems, sustainable development, real estate, purchasing, innovation) and run jointly by the Group's IT and Sustainable Development Dpts.

The Green-IT Committee and programme working groups were set in place in June 2009. Each group was responsible for carrying out the preliminary technical and cost studies needed for each initiative. The results of these studies were then used to set quantifiable and measurable targets and to define the indicators needed to monitor their progress and subsequent success."

Priorities:
-	cut down on business travel,
-	reduce and develop a clean vehicle park,
-	heighten staff awareness of the value of car-sharing and other more ecological methods of transport.

Highlights in 2009:
-	launch of Green-IT programme used in the development of alternatives to business travel,
-	setting of targets for the reduction in paper consumption per business line as part of the Carbon Plan 
-	launch of a new policy for cars in France 

Société Générale remains committed to reducing its environmental impact in terms of transport and business travel. 

The Group has already set up various measures designed to limit transport pollution. Many include collective action and initiatives to heighten staff awareness, such as the Group's company travel plan, its eco-comparator for business travel which calculates the level of CO2 emissions according to the chosen method of transport, and its car-sharing website. 
In partnership with its subsidiary ALD Automotive, Société Générale has also sought to reduce the carbon footprint of its fleet of vehicles. In 2009, the New Car Solution programme was launched with the aim of reducing the impact on the environment of the Group's vehicle fleet via the selection of vehicles that pollute less and other measures like its eco-driving lessons. The policy should bear its fruits in France in 2010. At the end of 2009, the average level of emissions generated by the Group's fleet in France stood at 131 g/km of CO2 and 165 g/km worldwide. 

The Green-IT programme will also mean the implementation of high-performance audio and video-conferencing equipment in order to improve the quality of long-distance teamwork and to limit the need for business trips"

In the US, a small central environmental team is supported by committees that focus on buildings, business travel and employee engagement.
In both the UK and the US, we have commissioned comprehensive reviews of our buildings identifying opportunities for carbon reduction. Building on these reviews, we have set up an online data collection system for utility and water billing in both countries. In addition, country committees have been established in Australia, Canada, India and South Africa.

In 2008, our businesses in the UK, the US, Canada and India commissioned comprehensive environmental reviews of our main buildings to help us identify opportunities for energy savings.  In the UK, we completed a carbon management programme with the Carbon Trust.   As a result of these reviews, we continue with our programme of introducing energy efficient features in many of our existing buildings:

Our Indiana Distribution Centre has become a zero landfill warehouse ensuring that all non-recyclable items are used for ""Waste to Energy"" generation. Our key buildings in the UK do not send any waste to landfill.
We reduced our electricity use in 80 Strand by over 10% through a programme of investment in intelligent lighting systems, server virtualisation and more efficient air-conditioning.

Trelleborg AB,Sweden,Public,Nordic 200,,Long,"Trelleborg needs to describe this in aggregate figures, as a detailed description would be far too extensive. We do not disclose detailed investment figures.

Energy savings 2009:

Total energy consumption 2009: 1,288 GWh (2008: 1,521) = 4,637 TJ (2008: 5,476) 
Total energy consumption/sales: 0.0476 GWh/SEK M (2008: 0.0487)


Energy savings is a focus area for Trelleborg. All production plants shall have an energy-savings plan. In 2009, Trelleborg’s Energy Excellence Program for systematic energy-efficiency enhancements was launched at all production units. Energy Excellence is based on self-assessment and the identification/implementation of improvement projects through specially trained coordinators at each production unit. These coordinators in turn form an improvement team to systematically implement savings measures pertaining to identified key areas such as 
- buildings, 
- compressed air systems, 
- heating/ventilation, 
- lighting and 
- cooling systems. 

Over time, the program is expected to generate distinct savings in the form of lower energy consumption and energy costs and to reduce the Group’s total carbon emissions. 

Result 2009: 1,288 GWh (2008: 1,521).
Improved energy efficiency has resulted in a 0.233 GWh saving compared with 2008.

This is a 2.2 percent decrease, relative to sales, compared with 2008.

Carbon dioxide emissions 2009:
Total CO2 emissions: 377,000 ton (2008: 405,000)
Direct CO2 emissions: 115 200 ton (2008: 132,000) 
Total CO2 emissions/sales: 13.9 ton/MSEK (2008: 12.9)

Decrease in absolute terms: 28,000 tons, however a 7-percent increase, relative to sales, compared with 2008. This is due to a. low sales figures in 2009, and b.  a new geographic mix of facilities, where higher conversion factors for indirect emissions are associated with China and other growth economies, where Trelleborg grows faster than in Western Europe, affect the calculated emissions."

Finnair,Finland,Public,Nordic 200,,Long,"From summer 2008 to September 2009 Finnair implemented a project which examined many measures affecting aircraft fuel economy, such as changes in the empty weight of aircraft, improving departure punctuality and renewing engines during regular maintenance. In addition, in cooperation with Finavia, a start was made on implementing landings using the Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) principle. As a result of the fuel-saving project, flight operations achieved a saving in fuel consumption of around two per cent in 2009. This represents around 15.6 million kilos of jet fuel. 
The energy consumption of properties has also been the focus of attention. Within the framework of an energy management agreement signed YIT, and which came into force at the beginning of 2008, the Group’s properties implemented many measures by which both electricity and heat consumption were reduced. The most important changes with respect to properties related to indoor temperatures, lighting control and ventilation systems. In December 2009 Finnair Facilities Management Oy, which is responsible for the Finnair Group’s properties, joined an energy efficiency agreement between the Confederation of Finnish Industries, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and sector unions. The parties to the agreement are committed to reducing properties’ energy consumption by nine per cent from the 2007 level by 2016.
Estimated savings in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in 2009. The effects of fleet modernisation are not included in the figures. In addition, business units and subsidiaries had their own internal energy-saving measures, but data on their effects has not been collected at the Group level."

Several BUs (mainly in the Asia region) are considering expanding the number of base stations based on renewable energy sources. This is currently particularly relevant for Pakistan and Bangladesh applying off-grid solar solutions. In Norway and other BUs with significant legacy installations, total network renovation may be required even after mobile network upgrading.  Concretely this may influence the speed of swapping TRXs e.g.  BU-targets for energy efficiency and CO2-emissions for 2010-12 will be set during Q2 2010 after the Non Financial Reporting for 2009 is available in late Q1 2010.
 
The main challenge for Uninor in India will be to improve infrastructure efficiency within the framework of the asset smart business model. Further initiatives towards 2017 will be focused on network upgrading and coverage optimization. Introduction of renewable energy will be relevant in off-grid areas, but with the current market conditions this is likely to contribute only marginally compared to the overall energy use forecasted for our Indian operations.

Primary focus is on reducing lighting and air-conditioning, as these generally consume the most electricity in commercial buildings. An energy strategy has been implemented. Key aspects of the strategy are: The baseline to measure electricity consumption against, an electricity target of 11% absolute reduction per building by 2012 is being targeted, an energy dashboard for large buildings, companies & business units is updated on a monthly basis to show business units how they are progressing towards the 11% reduction target, an energy forum assembles on a quarterly basis to collaborate energy saving initiatives using best practice. Initiatives  implemented include: Replacing magnetic ballasts with electronic ballasts in fluorescent lights, adjusting air conditioning settings slightly higher to reduce demand on the air-conditioner, replacing older air-conditioners and chillers with more energy efficient ones, window film or louvers on windows reduce heat entering a building, electricity optimisation products for air-conditioning reduce electricity demand, installing energy efficient lighting, installing sensors that switch off lights where there is no activity, setting the Building Management System to switch off lighting after hours. Results were that the total number of bulbs replaced with energy efficient bulbs - 26 159 and number of motion sensors installed - 2 342. This excludes the 130 branches that have replaced their bulbs and electronic control gear. There were also two DSM Lighting Retrofits projects implemented at: Bank City involving 18 200 bulbs replaced, and Selby where 5 662 bulbs were replaced. The total bulbs replaced with energy efficient bulbs in FirstRand is over 50 000. We have activated the energy saving (sleep mode) settings and schedule the shutting down of computers after hours, put timers on geysers. 14 transformers steps were adjusted to reduce this voltage by one step. This led to almost 5% electricity saving of more than R 70 000 pm. Roots Magazine (28 000 unit monthly staff magazine) contained a detailed article titled ‘Surviving the Power Crisis 101’ and a competition on what staff were doing to conserve energy at home was conducted."

The transition to natural gas allows the Company to stop most of its use of fuel oil and diesel fuel at ICL's facilities, thus enabling the reduction of associated emissions. As a result of this step, a 25% reduction of particles emission is expected as well as a reduction of 65% - 75% in the emission of sulfuric acid. The transition to natural gas is also expected to reduce the emission of CO2, leading to a major improvement in ICL's carbon footprint. 
Similarly, ICL’s Periclase, Rotem Amfert Negev, at Mishor Rotem and Bromine Compounds operations at Ramat Hovav are in the advanced stages of implementing a project to convert production facilities from heavy fuels (fuel oil and naphtha) to natural gas. The conversion should take place in 2010. 
These activities, to be performed by the end of 2010, are expected to reduce the Company’s carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 100 thousand tons per year.

Since the end of November 2007, an innovative system has been deployed to reduce the nitrous oxide emissions by about 80%. At this stage, the actual reduction achieved has reached 60%, and the Company is continuing its efforts to improve the performance of the system by supporting the developer of the technology, Johnson Matthey. The reduction achieved to date is equivalent to the prevention of emission of approximately 80,000 tons of carbon dioxide. The project was approved by the Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (CDMEB - UNFCC) with the backing of Israel’s National Committee for Clean Development.

Different gases can be used in this process, some of which have health and environmental effects. The gas used successfully by the magnesium industry around the world is known as SF6.

During 2009, OZ Minerals went through a significant change to its company structure, which included the sale of operations that had previously been assessed under the EEO program. The assessments had identified a number of energy efficiency opportunities at these operations, and a significant amount of work had been carried out in progressing the implementation of the initiatives. 
 
OZ Minerals retained ownership of the Prominent Hill operation in South Australia. The first quarter of 2009 was a milestone for the operation with the first copper concentrates exported to overseas markets. In effect this places the commencement date of the project from March 2009 and therefore the first complete capture of operational energy data for the operation. A requirement of the EEO program is to have two years of operational data to allow for an adequate assessment of the site’s emissions. The Prominent Hill Operation’s first Energy Efficiencies Assessment will therefore be completed by June 30 2011. 

Preparations for the EEO assessment commenced at Prominent Hill during 2009, including the initiation of a baseline energy assessment and efficiency project. The work to be conducted under the EEO program will drive the company's actions to reduce its GHG emissions."

Hence, the reduction initiatives represent a real reduction on Liberty’s electricity invoices. The savings achieved by individual initiatives have not been monitored given the challenge in doing this. For example, it is difficult to differentiate the saving from replacing lightbulbs from the saving for replacing old equipment or encouraging behavioural change.

Boral Ltd,Australia,Public,Australia 200,,Long,"Boral's absolute GHG emissions in 2008/09 decreased by 8% year on year. This decrease in emissions largely reflects lower production resulting from the significant housing market downturns in the USA and Australia. Emissions from Boral's US operations were down by around 41% on a comparable basis or around 147,000 tonnes of CO2. In Australia, emissions were down 150,000 tonnes of CO2 or around 4%. And in Asia, Boral's GHG emissions were down 22% or around 16,000 tonnes of CO2.

All divisions, with the exception of Plasterboard, reduced their absolute emissions during the year largely as a result of the market downturn. Plasterboard's emissions increased marginally due to the commissioning of the new Pinkenba plant, which for a period of time required two plants to be operating in Queensland before the Northgate plant was decommissioned. 

During the year, most of Boral's plants were operating well below capacity and a program of rolling plant shutdowns was implemented in most businesses to manage inventory levels and reduce production to match lower demand levels. Alternative fuel and energy efficiency improvements that have been implemented across the business will deliver greater benefits as market volumes recover and production lifts. 

In Boral's Quarry business in Australia, efficiency gains of 2% were delivered during the year, reflecting continued energy audits and energy efficiency programs."

Since locomotive diesel engines make up the majority of CN’s air emissions and fuel consumption, the Company continues to make significant investments in fleet renewal, remanufacture and retrofits.  These initiatives are described in greater detail below.
FLEET RENEWAL / ACQUISITIONS
CN is committed to renewing our fleet with more fuel-efficient locomotives.  Since the Company’s privatization in 1995, we have acquired 631 new locomotives under our regular fleet renewal program.  Specifically, for the period 2009-2010, the Company purchased 90 additional electro-motive diesel (EMD) locomotives.

This acquisition will enable retirement of older locomotives and the new EMD will The new EMD be up to 20 per cent more fuel-efficient than the ones they replace and comply fully with the latest regulatory requirements for reduced locomotive emissions.  In addition, the units are equipped with distributed power (‘DP’) with higher-power and higher-adhesion capabilities, requiring fewer locomotives to pull the same train weight.  With more optimum matching of motive power to train operations, these new locomotives result in economies in fuel consumption and reduction in emission intensities.  With the acquisition of more fuel-efficient locomotives in our fleet, we have been able to realize 15-25% fuel savings versus older models.  

FLEET REMANUFACTURE
To date, more than 300 of our core fleet of diesel locomotives have been remanufactured since 2002.  Remanufacturing our older locomotives increases reliability and ensures the locomotives meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 0 Regulations for NOx emission reductions.  Through the re-manufacture of our locomotives we have realized approximately 3 percent fuel improvement, which has translated into roughly CDN$ 35 Million of fuel savings to date.

RETROFITTING EXISTING LOCOMOTIVES
We continue to investigate options to retrofit existing switcher locomotive bodies with new tier-compliant diesel engines.  One of the options that is currently under review is the replacement of large conventional medium-speed diesel engines with multiple smaller industrial diesel engines packaged as individual generator sets (known as ‘GENSETs’), which could result in lower fuel consumption and emissions.  To date, the application of GENSETs is still in a testing stage."
Canadian National Railways,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Transport 100; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"EFFICIENTLY OPERATING THE RAILROAD
CN’s ‘Precision Railroading’ model is the foundation of the Company’s operational efficiency enabling the reliable and efficient movement of freight through precise planning of our railroad operations.  Through ‘Precision Railroading’, fewer railcars and locomotives are needed to ship the same amount of freight in a tight, effective and efficient operation, translating into greater reliability for customers, increased fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.  
INTERMODAL OPERATIONS
For customers who do not have direct access to rail, using both truck (for the short haul) and rail (for the long haul), represents a significant opportunity to reduce the GHG emissions associated with truck-only shipping.  CN has a large network of intermodal terminals across NA. Our innovative service model has enabled CN to become one of the most efficient intermodal railroads in NA. 
CO-PRODUCTION
Co-production refers to a cooperative effort between railroads to share track and rail infrastructure in an effort to improve the flow of traffic and maximize efficiencies for both carriers. For example, CN and CPR share a track in BC whereby all westbound trains of both railroads, usually carrying heavy commodities, operate over the CN line and all eastbound trains of both railroads, usually transporting lighter loads, operate over the CPR line. Fuel is saved by the single direction trains, as well as by trains using routes with the lowest grades to carry heavy loads.  
ROUTING PROTOCOLS
CN has a series of routing protocols with its U.S. interline partners, establishing the most efficient gateways for routing traffic between railroads –regardless of ownership. The routing protocols improve both transit time and asset utilization making the most efficient use of existing capacity and eliminating excess miles travelled on inefficient routings.  CN has routing protocol agreements with all six Class 1 North American railways.  
PRECISION FUEL MANAGEMENT
The Company initiated a fuel management program to manage fuel with greater precision.  Through this program, we expect to achieve accurate daily measures of fuel efficiency, reductions in fuel consumption, and increases in fuel productivity.  A 2% savings in fuel consumption per year is forecasted, which equates to approximately 14M per year."
Canadian National Railways,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Transport 100; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"FOCUSED FUEL CONSERVATION PRACTICES 
In operating the railroad, the Company haS been able to identify and promote a number of fuel conservation practices.  These include:
AUTOMATIC STOP/START DEVICES
In November 1996, CN began to equip its locomotive switching fleet with automatic stop / start devices.  These devices conserve fuel and reduce emissions by automatically shutting down locomotives when they are not in use, and powering them up again when required to maintain critical locomotive functions.  To date, over 50 percent of CN’s switcher fleet has been retrofitted to employ this feature. Furthermore, all new locomotives purchased by CN, as well as those locomotives that we overhaul, will be equipped with automatic stop / start devices.  As a result, CN has saved more than 1.5 M Litres of fuel throughout our Canadian operations by installing automatic stop / start devices.  This number is based on studies demonstrating that there are annual savings per locomotive on average of 30,000L, and the capital and installation costs can be recouped in approximately 2 years.  
LOW IDLE
At CN, we continue to apply the low idle feature to more of our locomotives.  This feature allows the diesel engine to idle at a reduced speed when locomotives are awaiting assignment or coasting down hill, saving approximately 10 litres of fuel per hour.  In addition, on the accepted duty cycles, savings can be up to 1 percent of the fleet annual fuel consumption.  Since 1980, all new locomotives purchased by the Company have had low idle features.  To date, approximately 60 percent of our fleet have applied the low idle feature."
Canadian National Railways,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Transport 100; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"FOCUSED FUEL CONSERVATION PRACTICES (Cont.)
LONGER TRAINS
We are working to increase train productivity through the use of longer trains, which permit improved utilization of locomotive power.  In order to enable longer trains, we have invested considerable capital into lengthening passing tracks and sidings, as well as equipping trains with distributed power.  Over the past 10 years, CN has invested CDN$325 Million on siding extensions.  As a result, the Company can run longer, heavier trains, including in cold weather conditions, while improving train handling, reducing train separations and ensuring the overall safety of operations.  In 2009, we spent $400 million to rail infrastructure projects in CNs western region where the Company also invested in extended sidings and terminal improvements to grow its business and permit more efficient movement of traffic in western Canada, including CN’s line to the new Port of Prince Rupert container terminal. 
TRAIN PACING, COASTING AND BRAKING STRATEGIES
Dynamic brake equipment allows the use of the dynamic brake to control train speed variations rather than the use of the air brake system.  As a result, fuel consumption is reduced.  Furthermore, where operations permit, the use of pacing or coasting to stop our trains rather than using heavy braking requiring engine power, has also enabled us to yield fuel and emission reductions.  Pacing is the use of better track / train management by the network management personnel to ensure trains are not rushing to stop at meets.  Meanwhile, coasting takes place when power is removed ahead of time so that the train slows down on its own. 
NOTCH LIMITING
The practice of notch limiting is undertaken when our locomotive crew personnel are instructed not to run their top notch setting when maximum power is not required.  A pilot project currently underway is showing significant benefits with respect to fuel savings."
Canadian National Railways,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Transport 100; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"FOCUSED FUEL CONSERVATION PRACTICES (Cont.)
RAIL LUBRICATION
Rail lubrication reduces surface friction between the rail and the freight cars, requiring less effort to maintain a specific speed.  This practice results in lower fuel consumption and lower GHG emissions.  To date, approximately 62 percent of CN’s locomotives are equipped with lubrication systems.  We also achieved the same results by applying lubrication to the flange of the locomotive wheel, which also reduces any friction. 
RE-ASSIGNING OLDER LOCOMOTIVES
When older locomotives are re-assigned to lines with less traffic it ensures new more fuel-efficient locomotives are used in the heaviest work cycle.  For example, we have recently expended resources to re-assign older locomotives in Alberta on the former Savage rail line. 
ACQUISITIONS OF TRUCKS FOR FREIGHT CARS
The Association of American Railroads (AAR) has required all new freight cars to be equipped with trucks (bogies) that steer better around curves.  This reduces lateral curve forces on the rails resulting in lower fuel consumption and less wear on the rail.  CN has purchased 2200 freight cars with 4400 M-976 trucks (bogies) since 2004.  
SMART INDICATORS
CN has installed weather stations on all switch warmers on its main line between Winnipeg and Montreal.  The systems monitor outside temperatures and humidity and when conditions for snow or freezing rain are predicted the units automatically warm the switches.  By using the smart indicators to ensure that the switches are heated only when required, CN has been able to reduce our switch energy consumption by 50 percent."
Canadian National Railways,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Transport 100; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"BETTER PRACTICES AND GREATER EFFICIENCY IN OUR RAIL YARDS 
Through better practices in our rail yards, we have been able to increase our operational efficiency, while significantly reducing our fuel consumption.  These practices include: 
• locomotive shutdowns in our yards in accordance with CN’s shutdown policy;
• streamlined car handling where our operators minimize switching moves; and, 
• crew training and awareness, including the Advanced Locomotive Refresher Training (ALERT), that focuses on the importance of fuel conservation practices.  
In order to assess performance, we review variances on an ongoing basis between how trains are operated and handled.  In 2008, our reviews indicated a 2/3 compliance rating.   These types of practices have been important contributors to our fuel reduction accomplishments, which to date stand at 30 percent since 1991.
Furthermore, the Company has invested more than CDN$ 100M to reconfigure the Harrison Yard switching facility to create a more efficient layout.  The completion of the reconfiguration positions CN to handle existing and future traffic growth in the region, more quickly and efficiently."
Canadian National Railways,Canada,Public,Canada 200,Transport 100; Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"IMPROVE NON-LOCOMOTIVE FUEL CONSUMPTION (ON COMPANY SERVICE FLEET) 
Improvements to fuel efficiency associated with the operation of our OCS vehicle fleet are being achieved  in two main areas. 

First, during our annual vehicle replacement program (approximately 400 vehicles per year), we purchase vehicles which provide state-of-the-art energy efficiency and emission reductions for both traditional power sources (ie. diesel and gasoline engines) and vehicles with alternative fuel efficient power sources such as hybrids.

Second, in order to continually improve our OCS fleet fuel efficiency (measured as kilometers operated per litres of fuel consumed), we track and manage three specific vehicle operating and utilization practices that have the greatest potential to improve vehicle fuel efficiencies and reduce total fuel consumption.  These are unnecessary vehicle idling, speeding and overall vehicle utilization. 

GPS (Geographic Positioning System) units are installed on all new OCS vehicles.  At the end of 2009, 1,100 vehicles of 4,500 (24% of the fleet) were equipped with GPS units. The GPS units are used to identify vehicles in which:
•	fuel efficiency can be improved and consumption reduced by reducing  unnecessary idling and eliminating speeding
•	fuel consumption can be eliminated altogether by removing the vehicle from CN's fleet due to insufficient utilization

CN has established an aggressive reporting and training program, accompanied by appropriate accountabilities, to reinforce with employees their role in improving fuel efficiencies and reducing total fuel consumption in a manner that continually maintains safety of operations.  The present fuel efficiency improvement target is to increase fuel efficiency by 5% in 2010."

CN has implemented a number of initiatives to target fuel and cost savings associated with our truck fleet operations.  These include:
a) Truck fleet acquisition / renewal program– CN has established a program to incentivize truck owners to acquire and renew their trucks in order to gain greater fuel efficiency.  To this end, CN has established tractors specifications (see one pager).  Through this program, CN provides substantial subsidies to cover truck upgrades based on specifications (including engine and cab heaters, roof fairing, side extensions, aero mirrors, fuel tank covers, and tires).  In addition, we also provide subsidies for the acquisition of new trucks, as required to meet our specifications.
b) Monitoring – Through our monitoring program, we anticipate additional fuel savings can be achieved through preventive maintenance detection activities.  This includes truck engine monitoring, semi-annual tractor inspections, and safety & efficiency testing for vehicles.
c) Product Design – CN works with our suppliers to optimize containers and chassis being hauled by our trucks.  For example, we are working with our chassis developer to build a test chassis that is lightweight, has a fixed length with side skirts as well as single tires.
d) Route Optimization:  CN works with our suppliers and customers to enable route optimization techniques that result in greater fuel efficiency.  For example, we are purchasing a new dispatch system that is slated for implementation for the first quarter of 2011.  Through route optimization we expect fuel savings of approximately 900,000 litres, which equates to approximately of 540, 000.  The system is also expected to gain additional savings in driver wait time, and thus idling time."

Upgrades to enhance energy efficiency in our operations
As part of the Company energy reduction initiatives directed at electricity and natural gas, CN has established a number of projects maximize energy efficiency in our buildings.  First, we are working with our sites to replace existing equipment with more energy efficient alternatives.  This includes:
a) Boilers at the Winnipeg / Symington Yard, 
b) Air compressors at our Edmonton facility, 
c) Renovation of old yard offices at Conneaut, Ohio;
d) Demolition of vacant buildings in Tennessee and Illinois;
e) Leaking air lines at the Halifax, Windsor, Winnipeg and Symington locations, and,
f) Lighting Towers and HVAC units at the Toronto and Macmillan yard.  
Acquisition and Installation of energy efficient technologies
CN continues to invest in the acquisition and installation of energy efficient technologies.  For example, in the past year we converted our three corporate logos at our headquarter buildings to LED lights.  Although brighter than ever, the change has resulted in significant energy savings, which amounted to approximately $CDN 45,000 in annual energy cost savings.
Green Office Buildings 
CN is increasingly looking to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-inspired criteria when it expands or builds new office space.  We have LEED inspired CN offices in Montreal, Edmonton and Homewood that use natural or energy-efficient lighting, variable ventilation systems and low volatile organic compound (VOC) carpeting and fabrics.  In Montreal, we have been able to realize annual savings of approximately CDN$100,000 at CN’s headquarters.  In Edmonton and Homewood we expect to implement various LEED elements, including high efficiency boilers, lighting controls, and energy efficient windows.  At this stage, the energy data associated with the buildings is still being compiled, and estimated savings have not yet been established."

Through the efficiencies of our IT system, CN is able to take on an increasingly proactive approach to operational decision-making, which effectively boosts our company’s energy / carbon efficiency. 
SERVICE RELIABILITY STRATEGY (SRS)
SRS is an integrated database system that manages all aspects of rail service delivery, which enables CN to manage detailed trip plans while dramatically improving service and realizing fuel consumption efficiencies.  Contains all car and train system information, which has been implemented since the 1990s.  We are currently working on a five year plan to replace the SRS with the Transportation Renewal Program, which will enable us to implement more modern interface and increased operational efficiencies.  One of the building blocks is the crew management system, which we are replacing with ICrew.  We expect to spend more than 80M, which is part of our initiative to upgrade existing technology.

SSE is to become the first utility in the UK to build and monitor its own development of zero-carbon homes. The 10-home development, under construction near Slough, is being built on land previously occupied by an SSE office building. The properties have been designed to achieve the highest specification for sustainable building, Code Level 6 in the Code for Sustainable Homes. The installation of renewable energy features will be carried out by SSE Contracting and SSE Utility Solutions. All new homes built in England from 2016 onwards must be zero carbon.

In one of the first ever live demonstrations of what will be needed to achieve highly energy efficient living, SSE will test the every-day performance of the technology installed in the homes, such as a photovoltaic (solar) roof and a renewable district heating system. The development will feature a renewable energy heat hub, housing five different types of micro-generation including air and ground source heat pumps, a biomass boiler and solar thermal panels. The homes will be fitted with the latest energy efficient appliances and SSE will use smart meters to monitor the energy and water usage of the homes for 24 months. 
The information gleaned will help SSE understand how householders respond and adapt to zero-carbon living. It will also provide SSE and its related companies, such as those linked with SSE Ventures, with valuable information to share with stakeholders such as construction partners, technology manufacturers and industry bodies."

In early 2010, SSE successfully completed the first community-wide energy reduction trials in the UK, helping two communities achieve a 10% reduction in their electricity consumption. The trials, part of the Energy Research Demand Project (EDRP), involved working with communities to help them achieve the reduction over a two-and-a-half-year period. 
The EDRP trials are managed by Ofgem, on behalf of the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, and aim to gain an understanding of how consumers react to improved information about their energy consumption. The trials consist of different elements using different methods to provide feedback on energy consumption. 
SSE was the only energy supplier in the EDRP to hold trials involving engagement with entire communities. The trials were held in North Leigh in Oxfordshire, Alyth in Perthshire and St Athan in South Wales. The communities of North Leigh and Alyth achieved their community-wide 10% energy reduction and received an award of £20,000 each from SSE. The trial in St Athan started later, and is therefore not due to be completed until later this year, but good progress is being made.

A variety of measures was available to each community including smart meters, real-time display devices (which show energy use in monetary value), energy efficiency advice and insulation offers."

Canadian Pacific Railway,Canada,Public,Canada 200,,Long,"1. Locomotive Fleet Renewal

Since 1995, CP has invested over $1.5B in new alternating current locomotives with higher horsepower and increased fuel efficiency.  Our most recent acquisitions include 200 GE Evolution® series locomotives which now represent 17% of the road fleet.  These locomotives are U.S. EPA Tier II compliant and use 3% less fuel and emit 40% less smog producing contaminants such as particulate matter than previous models."
Canadian Pacific Railway,Canada,Public,Canada 200,,Long,"2. New Technology Testing

CP perseveres in our search for a fuel efficient switcher locomotive replacement.  Locomotive specifications were sent to all established builders as well as new potential locomotive builders with a challenge to provide their version of a 4-axle switching locomotive solution.  The response was enthusiastic and seven builders emerged with their designs and commitments to build a prototype.  So far, CP has evaluated four prototypes with two more scheduled for spring 2010.  CP will be able to apply this knowledge to our 6-axle fleet (SD40s) renewal strategy.

With the support of Transport Canada’s Freight Technology Demonstration Fund, CP acquired two new National Railway Equipment Genset locomotives for testing in southern Ontario.  These units could reduce fuel consumption by up to 40% and air pollutants by between 80 and 90% compared to existing switching locomotives."
Canadian Pacific Railway,Canada,Public,Canada 200,,Long,"3. Idle Reduction

CP has applied automatic engine start stop technology to 95% of our yard engines and 80% of our road fleet.  This technology limits idling to only what is necessary to protect the engine and has resulted in a reduction of 40 million litres of fuel since 2002.  The systems operate all year, however, the shut down opportunity is currently restricted to above-freezing temperatures.

CP is currently testing a new generation anti-idling technology, known as a self-contained layover system,  that will operate without any temperature restrictions.  Fuel savings of three times the typical start-stop systems is anticipated."
Canadian Pacific Railway,Canada,Public,Canada 200,,Long,"4. Fuel Trip Optimizer

Following operational testing which indicated fuel savings ranging from 6 to more than 10% depending on territory, CP has equipped all 200 GE Evolution locomotives with GE Tranpsortation’s Fuel Trip Optimizer (FTO).  This is the product’s first commercial deployment.  FTO is an advanced energy management system that optimizes fuel consumption based on a specific train’s configuration and the route traveled.

The system evaluates train length, weight, grade, track conditions, weather and locomotive performance to calculate the most efficient way of running the train while maintaining smooth train handling.  Operation of FTO is similar to the autopilot feature in today’s jetliners.  Train crews retain responsibility for safe operation of the train and can engage or disengage the system at any time."
Canadian Pacific Railway,Canada,Public,Canada 200,,Long,"5. Rail Lubrication

In areas with high track curvature, the resulting wear on the track and wheel impacts fuel consumption of the trains.  CP is implementing a total friction management approach which involves a combination of both gauge face and top of rail lubrication to reduce rail and wheel wear on high curvature track.  The focus has been on a 900 mile section in Western Canada where over 300 top of rail lubrication systems have been installed.  In combination with existing gauge face lubrication sites, the estimated annual fuel savings is almost 7 million litres."
Canadian Pacific Railway,Canada,Public,Canada 200,,Long,"6.  Operating Plan Strategies

Operating plan strategies involve efforts to increase the capacity of our core franchise and improve fluidity in the overall rail network.  These improvements also result in reductions in GHG emissions due to more efficient train movements.

Pacing

Rail traffic controllers have the ability to pace trains over a territory to minimize fuel consumption while maintaining a given level of performance.  Pacing charts are used to determine optimal performance for the locomotives not equipped with FTO.

Distributed Power

CP is analyzing the effects of various power distribution models (number and position of locomotives within the train consist) to achieve the lowest overall system cost including fuel consumption.

Co-production Agreements

CP has expanded its physical network and capacity through various innovative infrastructure sharing and joint service programs with other railways which also serve to improve GHG and fuel efficiencies.  

Other initiatives include 45 mph speed restrictions on non-expedited trains, the use of dynamic braking over power braking at higher throttle positions and optimizing HP/ton ratios."
Canadian Pacific Railway,Canada,Public,Canada 200,,Long,"7.  Railcar Fleet Modernization

Starting in 1998, CP has undertaken a freight car modernization program to fully leverage its rail network and locomotive fleet.  These cars are lighter and yet have higher capacity.  New automotive carriers, covered hoppers, open tops, box cars, gondolas and flats can carry more goods more efficiently. In the last two decades CP has spent over $1.5B on acquiring new high capacity rail cars to further improve operating and fuel efficiencies.

Double-stacking and improved standardization of containers has further improved the density of Intermodal trains.  To accommodate the new double stack height, significant capital dollars were expended raising the clearance in railway tunnels."
Canadian Pacific Railway,Canada,Public,Canada 200,,Long,"8.  Biodiesel Demonstration Project

Preparing for the future, CP has partnered with Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to test the reliability of a 5% biodiesel blend fuel in railway service under cold weather conditions.

Over a five month period ending March 31, 2010, four biodiesel-powered GE AC4400 locomotives, a model which make up 75% of our active fleet,  operated in daily service between Calgary and Edmonton.  This will allow us to (i) evaluate locomotive performance; (ii) identify potential implications on maintenance and replacement frequency of engine components; (iii) evaluate potential fuel efficiency implications; and (iv) share results with the federal government and other railways in advance of proposed regulation.  

Mandating the introduction of biodiesel, considered a cleaner, renewable alternative to traditional fuels, into the fuel supply system is one of the federal government’s strategies to reduce Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions."

The process is a structured multidisciplinary review of the energy use at a faciity. GE has identified and implemented numerous cost effective projects to upgrade lighting, HVAC, and industrial process equipment and to better manage energy use through more than 200 Treasure Hunt events since 2005.  GE also offers rewards and recognition to sites that reduce GHG emissions.  In 2009, GE recognized 50 of its sites as eCO2 award winners. These sites had at least a five percent reduction in GHG emissions versus the baseline year independent of changes in production levels.

Data for this answer was obtained from GE's Project Deck, an internal GHG reduction and energy efficiency project tracking data base. Data represents the results reported by GE site and business personnel for those projects that were reported as being completed during 2005 to 2009. The annual energy savings are the reported annual kWh of electricty saved by the projects. Additional energy savings may have resulted from reduced or more efficient use of fuels. The GHG emission reductions are the reported annual reductions achieved by the projects. The investment number is the total reported capital investments and expenses needed to implement the projects. Additional operating and maintenance expenditures from 2005 to 2009 have been approximately $4,000,000. The monetary savings number is the reported cumulative savings from the projects from 2005 to 2009."

-	Astrium’s building at the Elancourt site in the Paris 
-	Airbus’s Stade plant near Hamburg, in Germany, is one of the world’s leading centers for production of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP). Through a combined heat and power (CHP) unit, management has achieved a step change in energy efficiency. The unit burns gases to generate power, but the waste gases (mainly CO2) are then used in the process of curing CFRP at high pressure. Being chemically inert gases, they provide a non-combustible atmosphere during curing. In the past, the method for obtaining nitrogen from the air for this process was extremely energy-intensive. The reduction in energy costs from the curing process alone means the investment in the CHP unit can be recovered in just one year. Furthermore, the CO2 emitted is recycled, meaning the CHP unit produces almost no pollutants, and the waste heat is used to heat hangars and offices. 
-	Additionally, the China building energy team has made savings in heating and cooling at the Airbus Beijing Campus through innovative solutions such as using outside air for the cooling system and a geothermal energy heating system. This has reduced electricity use by 50%."

- All light fittings in stores have been changed to energy efficient fittings. 
- Woolworths only uses electronic ballasts, in place of magnetic chokes in stores, depots and offices, resulting in a 15% saving in lighting costs;
- The electrical profiles of selected stores, depots and offices are monitored remotely to ensure that lighting and air-conditioning units are managed in the most efficient way, with an aim to extend this to all facilities within the next six months;
- Automated lighting switching equipment has been installed in our top 100 stores to ensure that lights do not remain on after hours; This programme is being rolled out more broadly at present. 
- Woolworths has conducted awareness programmes, campaigns and presentations at stores for the last 25 years to educate staff about efficient use of energy;
- Woolworths was amongst the first retailers to sell energy efficient light bulbs in South Africa and no longer stocks incandescent light bulbs.
- Woolworths, in association with Nova Lighting, has concluded an agreement whereby Nova offers an in-store collection facility for the safe disposal of redundant CFL (energy saving) light bulbs.
This facility was launched in 2008, in 46 flagship stores across South Africa. The collection bin has been specially designed to ensure that there is no danger of CFL lamp breakage. The bins will be regularly removed by Nova Lighting for disposal in accordance with all relevant South African legislation.
Woolworths already makes use of Novas safe disposal, sending all the used fluorescent lighting from stores to Nova for disposal in accordance with the South African legislation."

Steps have been taken to eliminate, as far as possible, ozone depleting gases. -- All stores use HCFCs (Hydrochlorofluorocarbons) for refrigeration and blends of HCFCs and HFCs (Hydrofluorocarbons) are used in air conditioning and freezers. Any Woolworths contractor must use gas-reclaiming equipment when carrying out repairs. The refrigeration in Woolworths new distribution centre in Gauteng runs on an ammonia glycol mix which has zero global warming potential.
- None of Woolworths stand alone food stores have air-conditioning, except in KwaZulu-Natal where the air-conditioning is required to control humidity;
- Energy efficient refrigeration plants installed in stores and depots over recent years have reduced the power consumed by refrigeration by up to 40%;
- Frozen foods are displayed in closed refrigeration cabinets - this has been the practice for over a decade, reducing energy usage in the freezers;
- Waste heat, recycled from the refrigeration system, is pumped back in to the food market (&free heating), helping to maintain comfortable trading conditions.

All professional teams involved in our building developments are required to use these guidelines in building design and development. Woolworths considers the following energy saving measures when considering new real estate opportunities:
- Natural ventilation including openable windows to offices and cross ventilation;
- Energy efficient lighting and the use of a Building Management System for light switching;
- Solar powered water heating;
- Re-use of heat generated by plant and machinery to heat buildings in cold periods of the year.
- LED lighting for exterior signs
- CO2 refrigeration system
- Under floor heating in the food market using waste heat and heat pumps and Heat reclaim system for food market and cooling
- Natural lighting via exhaust extraction vents

- Woolworths has already taken steps to reduce vehicle emissions by recycling used cooking oil to generate a 5% bio-diesel mix in part of our fleet resulting in a saving of 1500 tons of CO2 per annum. Technical requirements from Mercedes Benz in Germany are delaying an increase in the percentage blend used. 
- Increase in distributable units distributed per litre of diesel used and per kilometre travelled. Target: 2012 targets of 9.7 DU/litre and 4.44 DU/km. n the last financial year, we reported that the real cost of distribution per unit reduced over the last three years.
- Woolworths sources over 95% of our food locally, based on country of origin labelling.
- Less that 0.1% of our food is air-freighted and we ensure that we only use this form of transport where local alternatives are not available. 
- A route optimization project in conjunction with the Imperial group has resulted in a reduction of km’s traveled and cost savings. 
- Reducing fuel consumption through the use of Euro 5 technology in conjunction with Imperial. 5 new vehicles are being used to trial this programme. Euro 4 technology is only required by 2014 in terms of current SA legislation, so we feel the programme gives us a significant advantage. Engen is ensuring the availability of low sulphur diesel for us. The Euro 5 trucks are being equipped with Bluetec technology with 80% fewer particles and 60% less nitrous oxide and a 2-5% fuel saving, estimated at 600 000 litres of diesel per year. 
- Improving refrigeration through the eco-fridge project. By using nitrogen refrigeration in our fleet, we estimate an approximate saving of 3000 tons of CO2 per annum, through diesel reductions, as well as efficiency benefits and noise reductions. The first four units are currently on the road."

Studies into the characteristics of the main surface ventilation fans have shown that energy can be saved by throttling the fans back during times when less air is required in the mines (e.g. on Sundays). This is achieved by adjusting the inlet guide vanes to the fan. Whereas this adjustment was done only periodically in the past to match the fan output to the required maximum duty, it was realised that an active control system on the guide vanes could save a significant amount of energy."

Removal of limestone from the furnaces frees this energy up to be applied to the smelting of additional new concentrate, effectively lowering the specific energy consumption (SEC) in MWh/t of new concentrate smelted.  With a reduced limestone addition of 7%, a roughly 10% higher amount of concentrate can be smelted, all else being equal. This results in an effective 10% lowering in specific energy consumption."

The SEE project developed as a result of a study on Mine to Mill (M2M) and discussions about the future of the concept. M2M is essentially about blasting the ideal fragmentation to improve throughput in the downstream processing plant. It crosses the boundary between mining and process, and requires good communication between, and understanding of, both functions. SEE is essentially a software simulation package that will enable integration of the mining and processing functions. The scope has been extended in both directions along the value chain so that it is no longer ‘Mine to Mill’ but ‘Resource to Market’. Phase 1 of SEE is limited to the final concentrate, not final metal. Future phases of the project will extend the value chain further. SEE modelling software allows for the optimisation of recovery by altering the mine plan to suit ore blending and scheduling into a concentrator. The SEE project will measure recovered ounces, overall cost, energy consumption, CO2e emissions and water consumption. The SEE software is currently being implemented at Anglo Platinum’s Mogalakwena operation."
Anglo Platinum,South Africa,Public,South Africa 100,Global 500; FTSE All-World 800; Emerging Markets 800,Long,"Optimisation. An example of process optimisation is the alignment of process activities, such as reducing the quantity of steel balls in the milling circuit when the production is capped. This will reduce the energy demand during periods of lower production although the energy intensity per ton of concentrate remains the same. In 2009 when the production of high-grade PGM-bearing concentrate was capped at 2.5 million tons, the corresponding energy consumption was reduced by 15% through the alignment of process activities. The optimisation of crushing and grinding systems is still ongoing. The management of smelter load also offers energy efficiency opportunities."

These come already fitted with improved lighting, a better seating configuration, roll-over protection and proximity devices.

In particular, the reduction of natural gas emissions from transport activity as a percentage of gas injected into the network, is pursued by using gas recovery technology
when laying new methane pipelines and sections of greater diameter. The development plan will continue by means of:
- measures involving the reduction of pneumatic emissions from equipment, or the powering of the pneumatic devices with air, instead of gas, at certain
interconnection points;
- new reduction systems and new compressor stations with low pneumatic emissions;
- interventions on existing reduction systems involving the introduction of emission-free, pilot-actuated valves;
- interventions involving the elimination of pneumatic emissions from filter exhausts.

The reduction of CO2 direct emissions is pursued adopting gas-fired combined cycle with 56-58% energy efficiency (compared with the approximate 40% efficiency of
conventional steam cycle), that can reduce CO2 emissions by 52%, compared with a traditional fuel oil plant and by 62% compared with a coal-fired plant."

Close to one hundred thousand tonnes per year of pulp and paper biosolids are diverted from landfills and are used as a soil amendment material by Porcupine. If this waste material was placed in landfills, it would decompose anaerobically (without air) producing methane gas. Methane has a global warming potential of around 23 (averaged over 100 years). However, placed in a thin layer on top of tailings or rock piles, the biosolids will decompose aerobically, releasing carbon dioxide instead of methane.

By the end of 2009, the running total of these reductions was 7.9 million tonnes.

We factor a carbon cost into our investment appraisals and the engineering design of new projects. New BP investments with material carbon emissions are required to include a cost of carbon that can realistically be expected over the life of the project, currently $40 per tonne of CO2 for projects in industrialized countries. This is used as a basis for assessing the economic value of the investment, and for optimizing the way the project is engineered. This helps to keep our investments competitive not only in today’s world but in a future where carbon has a more robust price."

Lonza Group AG,Switzerland,Public,Switzerland 100,,Long,"The plant in Visp (CH) signed a target agreement with the responsible national authorities about voluntary measures to reduce CO2 emissions by 18 % (baseline: 2000) by 2012. Lonza AG in Visp has since invested over CHF 3 million, so far realizing a total of 11 measures, achieving energy savings of 150 000 megawatt hours to date. 

The energy efficiency program, Community of Practice in Energy (CoPE ), was launched worldwide, with the objective of achieving a 10% reduction in Group-wide energy costs by 2015.

At the Braine (BE) and Verviers (BE) locations, older cooling aggregates were replaced by new, more energy-efficient ones. At the Verviers plant, this also involved replacing the ozone-depleting R22 chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant.

In Slough (GB), an energy-management team has been deployed, with the target of reducing the carbon footprint by 20 %, compared with 2007, during the period from 2008 to 2010. Several measures have been introduced and partly realized.

In Nansha (CN), the use of heat exchangers in the waste incineration plant enables energy to be recovered in the form of steam, replacing 450 metric tons of heating oil, which represents 13% of the overall heating-oil requirements of the site. 

The Lonza biotechnology site in Tuas (SG) has built a 2 000 m2 photovoltaics array at a cost of SGD 1.8 million; this will replace 104 metric tons of CO2 emissions."

In 2008 we launched a global metering project to bring energy savings by cutting waste. We are investing $600,000 to install meters in our top 100 strategic locations that are both large and have long leases, meaning that we can invest at the sites. These sites represent 40% of our property portfolio by floor space. Meters will also be installed when we refurbish buildings or acquire new sites. 

The meters are used to centrally monitor energy consumption, bringing savings of between 10% and 15%. They will help us determine the most efficient and cost-effective ways of achieving energy savings. These may include: fitting timer switches to ensure lights are not left on overnight; adding movement and daylight sensors to ensure lights are only on when needed; installing energy-efficient lamps; fitting flow restrictors to hot water taps and upgrading boiler controls; fitting movement sensors to turn off equipment such as printers and copiers when offices are unoccupied; improving temperature controls on heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems; installing building management systems that monitor and control ventilation and lighting. 

Improved metering also assures that we are being charged accurately by our energy suppliers. The meters have already enabled us to identify overcharging at three sites which will save us around $260,000 each year.

In 2009 WPP completed pilot projects at three London companies to find ways to cut the amount of energy used by our printers and to reduce the amount of ink, toner and paper. The projects involved combining copiers, printers and scanners in one device; removing printers from desks to a central location and minimising the numbers of printers in use; implementing default settings to  save energy, ink, toner and paper (e.g. double sided printing and black and white settings); implementing 'follow me' printing. This means that print jobs will only be delivered when people swipe a key card on the printer, reducing the number of unwanted print jobs; introducing software to prevent waste through poor formatting; reducing waste in procurement of ink, toner and paper; negotiating recycling arrangements with manufacturers of ink and toner cartridges. 

The projects have bought significant savings and in 2010 we will expand managed print projects to key markets.

PSA Peugeot Citroën is continuing to optimize conventional internal combustion engines to improve their fuel efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint, by deploying advanced technological solutions in engine architecture, fuel intake systems and injection systems. 
PSA Peugeot Citroën has developed extensive expertise in diesel powertrains, which consume less fuel and emit less CO2 while delivering the same performance as equivalent petrol engines.
Developed in cooperation with Ford Motor Company, commonrail, direct-injection HDi diesel engines deliver outstanding driving comfort and reduce CO2 emissions by a significant 20% compared with the previous-generation diesels. These benefits have made the HDi one of the best selling engines in Europe, where diesels represented more than 45% of unit sales in 2009. In 2009, the Group unveiled a new 3-litre V6 HDi diesel designed for the Citroën C5 and C6 and the Peugeot 407 Coupé. In compliance with Euro 5 emissions standards, the new engine delivers a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions compared with the 2.7-litre V6 engine it replaced. Some 1.27 million HDi powerplants were produced in 2009, bringing total output to more than 13.7 million units since 1998.
In 2009, Peugeot introduced the 207 1.6-litre HDi, which emits just 99 g/km of CO2 thanks to a particularly efficient technical package that includes special aerodynamics and optimized engine calibration. Citroën will also bring 99 g/km diesel versions of the DS3 and the new C3 to the European market in the first quarter of 2010."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Improving Fuel Efficiency and Reducing Petrol Exhaust Emissions
Since 2006, PSA Peugeot Citroën has been offering the 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engines developed jointly with BMW Group, which deliver a 10 to 15% reduction in CO2 emissions compared with their predecessors. By the end of 2009, 1.3 million of these engines had already been produced.
A new stage in the cooperation began in January 2010 with the signature of an agreement to jointly develop the next generation of Euro 6-compliant 4-cylinder petrol engines.
At the same time, the Group is also working on a new family of 1-litre and 1.2-litre, 3-cylinder petrol engines, which are scheduled for launch in 2012. The new powerplant will make it possible to offer cars that emit less than 100 g of CO2/km without additional technology.
To curb carbon emissions from its vehicles in China, the Group also plans to bring six new petrol engines to the local market by 2020, starting with the new 2.3-litre VTEC engine debuted on the Citroën C5."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Using Alternative Fuels
Another way to reduce a vehicle’s carbon footprint is to explore the use of other fuels than petrol and diesel, such as natural gas, LPG and biofuels. The energy efficiency and environmental performance of these alternative fuels vary widely depending on each market’s specific features."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
PSA Peugeot Citroën markets vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) in markets where CNG is already a viable alternative to petrol and diesel, such as China, Iran, Turkey and Argentina. CNG not only helps to reduce tank-to-wheel carbon emissions by 20% compared with petrol, it also enables engines to deliver exceptional fuel efficiency.
In addition, CNG versions of the Peugeot Partner and Citroën Berlingo light commercial vehicles and the Citroën C3 supermini are already available in a number of European countries (Italy, The Netherlands, France)."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) 
Manufactured as a by-product in refineries or extracted from natural gas fields, LPG generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions than petrol (well-to-wheel emissions are on a par with diesel) and emits very little particulate matter. This is why its use is encouraged by tax incentives in certain countries, such as Italy and the Netherlands, which make it a particularly interesting alternative fuel.
In Italy, Peugeot offers a retrofit LPG kit for the Peugeot 206+, 207 and 207 SW."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Biofuels
The wider use of biofuels raises a host of social and environmental issues. This is why PSA Peugeot Citroën supports the development of so-called “sustainable” biofuels, which comply with the standards being explored in Europe and globally, for example to avoid the adverse impact of diverting farmland from food to energy crops. According to European Union directive 2009/28/ EC on renewable energies, to be certified as sustainable, biofuels must have a positive environmental, economic and social impact. In particular, they must effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 35% today and by at least 60% in 2018."

All of the Group’s petrol-powered models produced since 1 January 2000 can run on SP95-E10 (a blend of regular unleaded petrol (SP95) and 10% plant-derived ethanol).
PSA Peugeot Citroën has also developed fl ex-fuel engines that can run on ethanol/petrol blends of up to 85% ethanol in Europe (E85) and from 20 to 100% ethanol in Brazil. In the latter country, the  world’s largest market for ethanol and flex-fuel vehicles, the Group markets flex-fuel versions of the Peugeot 206 and the Citroën C3, C4 and Xsara Picasso. In 2009, these vehicles accounted for more than 65% of the petrol vehicles sold by the Group in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay) and close to 85% of those sold in Brazil.
In addition, flex-fuel versions of the Peugeot 308 and Citroën C4 and C5 were marketed in several European countries in 2009, with the majority sold in Sweden."

All of the Group’s diesel vehicles can run on a biodiesel blend of up to 30%, provided that the fuel is of high quality and the vehicle is maintained accordingly (diesel filter, lubricant, etc.).
The Group’s service fleet, which totals around 700 vehicles travelling some 14 million kilometres per year, has been running on B30 biodiesel for more than a decade."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Stop & Start System
Stop & Start technology shuts down the engine automatically when the vehicle is standing still or in neutral – at a red light, for example – and starts it up again instantly and noiselessly when reactivated by the driver. As a result, it helps to reduce carbon emissions by up to 15% in city driving. When combined with the system’s cost-effectiveness, these features make Stop & Start an efficient solution to a number of traffic-related issues in cities, where 75% of Europeans live.
First-generation Stop & Start technology was introduced on the Citroën C2 and C3 in 2004. The second generation, equipped with a more powerful integrated starter-generator that allows regenerative braking, will be launched in the second half of 2010 and deployed on virtually every Peugeot and Citroën model in Europe in 2011, marketed under the name “e-HDi”. Economies of scale from the forecast volumes will ensure that the system is widely affordable. The Group’s objective is to have sold a total of one million vehicles equipped with Stop & Start technology by the end of 2013.

PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Hybrids
PSA Peugeot Citroën is actively preparing the deployment of a range of hybrid technologies, combining an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, that will deliver significant improvements in fuel efficiency and carbon emissions (to less than 99 g/km), particularly in city driving. 
PSA Peugeot Citroën’s HYbrid4 diesel hybrid technology represents a major breakthrough in terms of fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions in the European market, offering gains of nearly 35% compared with the equivalent HDi diesel model. The drivetrain combines the high fuel efficiency of the HDi diesel in highway driving with all the benefits of electric propulsion on city and suburban roads. It also offers all-wheel drive capability, thanks to the electric motor mounted on the rear axle assembly, as well as the Stop & Start system and a particulate filter.
The technology will initially equip distinctive Peugeot and Citroën models, starting with the Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 and the Citroën DS5 HYbrid4 scheduled for market launch in 2011. They are expected to emit just 99 g/km of CO2.
As part of its strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles sold in China, the Group plans to bring HYbrid4 petrol hybrids to the Chinese market by 2015."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Plug-in Hybrids
The Group is working on a plug-in hybrid, i.e. an EV that can be recharged almost anywhere from a simple electric socket. An enhanced battery pack will enable the plug-in to run in all-electric mode for between 15 and 50 kilometres, which corresponds to most motorists’ daily needs. It therefore offers all the benefits of an EV for day-to-day use, but can also handle longer distances thanks to its internal combustion engine. Wide-scale testing will be carried out on an initial fleet of around a hundred vehicles starting in 2011, ahead of the technology’s market launch in 2012. The long-term objective is to reduce these plug-ins’ CO2 emissions to less than 50 g/km."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Electric Vehicles
In late 2010, PSA Peugeot Citroën will introduce two newgeneration city EVs developed in conjunction with Mitsubishi Motors, the Peugeot iOn and the Citroën C-Zero. With a driving range of 130 kilometres, these vehicles are capable of satisfying 90% of motorists’ daily transport needs. PSA Peugeot Citroën aims to ensure that these EVs have similar total cost of ownership to internal combustion engine vehicles. It will also help to set up systems for battery collection, reuse and recycling.
The Group’s EV line-up will also include two electric commercial vehicles, the Peugeot Partner Origin and Citroën Berlingo First, developed in cooperation with Venturi Automobiles. Designed more specifically for fleet use, their Zebra sodium nickel chloride battery, located under the bonnet, offers a range of 100 kilometres and can be charged from a simple mains socket. 250 of these vehicles have already been ordered under a pilot tender from the French Post Office."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Fuel Cell Vehicles
Over the longer term, the Group is exploring possible applications of hydrogen fuel cell technology. In December 2009, it presented its Peugeot 307 CC FiSyPAC demonstrator, which is equipped with a range extender and the Genepac fuel cell stack developed jointly with the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). It uses less than one kilogram of hydrogen per 100 kilometres, ranking it among the best-in-class worldwide.
PSA Peugeot Citroën has successfully quadrupled the fuel cell’s lifespan and increased its efficiency by nearly 20% since 2006.
As a result, process engineering and mass marketing would seem foreseeable as from 2020-2025. However, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are still a long way from the technical and economic maturity needed to support mass-market production. Although considerable progress has been made, hydrogen fuel cell technology must still overcome a number of obstacles, such as the cost of the fuel cell system and the lithium ion batteries, the fuel cell’s lifespan and the deployment of the necessary infrastructure to market hydrogen to the general public."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Equipment
In addition to working on engines, PSA Peugeot Citroën is improving the overall fuel efficiency of its vehicles by optimizing various vehicle components and equipment:
• Equipping certain models with electronic manual gearboxes, which can improve fuel efficiency by up to 5%.
• Optimizing air-conditioning components, like the evaporator and compressor, to reduce the energy required to run the system, and eventually replacing R134a, the current refrigerant, with new solutions that contribute less to global warming.
• Selecting tyres that offer the best trade-off between grip (primary safety) and low rolling resistance, given that a 10% reduction in rolling resistance reduces a vehicle’s carbon emissions by an average of 2 g/km. PSA Peugeot Citroën prefers very low rolling resistance (VLRR) tyres and is widely deploying tyre pressure sensors.
• Equipping certain models, such as the Peugeot 207 and 207 SW and the Citroën C3 and DS3, with a gear change indicator that promotes eco-driving by indicating the best time to upshift. 
• Offering an online service record and eco-driving service via Citroën’s e-Touch telematics service."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Vehicle Mass
Mass has a direct influence on a car’s fuel efficiency, and therefore on its carbon emissions, with a 100 kg reduction in weight delivering a gain of an average 4 g/km. To shrink the environmental footprint of its models, PSA Peugeot Citroën is therefore actively reducing their mass, with the goal of making vehicles in development more than 100 kg lighter than the previous models, while continuing to meet cost and performance specifications, particularly in the area of safety. Teams also pay careful attention in selecting a vehicle’s base materials, starting with the metals that on average account for around 70% of its total weight."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Aerodynamics
A vehicle’s performance also depends on its aerodynamics. PSA Peugeot Citroën uses wind tunnel testing and digital modelling to reduce a car’s drag area (CdA) without compromising on the other technical, practical, aesthetic and regulatory parameters involved in vehicle design, such as styling, safety, stability, storage space, engine cooling, rainwater drainage and acoustics. A 0.05 m2 reduction in drag area reduces a vehicle’s carbon emissions by 2.5 g/km."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Using Green Materials
To optimise the use of resources, PSA Peugeot Citroën is focusing much of its research on polymers, since most of the other materials, such as metals and fluids, are already recyclable and extensively recycled. Polymers account for almost 20% of a vehicle’s total mass.
Since 2008, the Group has deployed an ambitious plan to increase the proportion of green materials, by weight, in a vehicle’s total polymers (excluding tyres) to 20% by 2011 and to 30% by 2015, from an average 6% in 2007. For the Group, green materials include three families of materials: recycled plastics, natural materials (wood, vegetable fibres, etc.) and biomaterials (made from renewable instead of petrochemical feedstocks). Their use offers a number of benefits, such as reducing the use of fossil plastics and fostering the development of plastics recycling processes by increasing demand.
Each vehicle project has a contractual objective for the use of green materials.
Progress towards fulfilling the green materials plan may be illustrated by the Citroën C3 Picasso, in which green materials make up around 11% of its 170 kg of polymers (excluding tyres).
Examples include natural fibres, used to make the rear parcel shelves, boot carpeting and door insets, and recycled automotive plastics, used as raw material for mudguards.
Green materials represent nearly 20% of the Citroën C3 Picasso e-HDi demonstrator unveiled in early 2010, in such new components as floor mats, seat cushion foam, wheel trims and the fuel tank.
On the Peugeot 207, rear view mirror support stalks are made of hemp-fibre reinforced polypropylene instead of the traditional fibreglass. A life cycle assessment performed in 2009 by French environmental consulting firm EVEA showed that the new component delivered significant environmental benefits, reducing weight by 4%, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 14% and water use by 43%."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Car manufacturing
Even if the impacts are lower than the car emissions, PSA has worked for a long time, to make all his plants completely respectful of environmental legal constraints and to lower its contribution to greenhouse effect. 
The GHG emission reduction global objective is handled through an energy reduction plan with a view of cutting global costs with a long term view. It lays on : 
- The study of the best balance between cost of investment, industrial performance and environmental performance, including risk management,
- study of all opportunity to reduce or optimize energy consumption, through increasing the use of natural gas, replacing fuel oil and coal, and ramping up cogeneration facilities at some sites.
- Study and use if necessary of Best References for combustion plants 
- Set up of energy spare management in each plant with a precise counting of all energy consumption
- Training plan to ensure the implication of every worker to reduce energy consumption at its workplace.
- Best practices identification and spreading out over all facilities.
The Group’s strategy is based on an ambitious energy consumption reduction plan.
The main contributor to the emission reduction is the energy management plan developed in PSA plant for many years. We monitor the effect of this plan on the emission since 1995."
PSA Peugeot Citroen,France,Public,France 250,Euro 300,Long,"Managing significant impacts from other sites (R&D, design, administrative, spare parts centers…)
In addition to its efforts at production units, the Group has taken measures to reduce the most significant environmental impacts from other sites, including replacement parts facilities, R&D and administrative centres, and the Peugeot and Citroën dealership networks. In 2007, it extended its ISO 14001 certification programme to the Trnava industrial site, the Vesoul replacement parts facility and the La Garenne technical centre. Next up will be the Belchamp centre.
As part of its environmental programme, PSA Peugeot Citroën has also taken steps to optimise paper use by printing only when necessary and facilitating wastepaper recycling.

While we do encourage our travel vendors to improve their own fleet efficiency, the most direct way we can reduce emissions from travel is by reducing travel itself. Based on internal surveys, the most common purposes for business travel are meetings with customers and partners, internal meetings, and events (in our carbon footprint, Autodesk reports emissions from event-related travel separately from regular business travel). 

To reduce travel to meetings, we have made significant investments in virtual collaboration technologies. These include 18 Telepresence systems, more than 50 Roundtable systems, and a Live Meeting and webcam system that we plan to install on every computer. We are also rolling out extensive training and support programs to encourage employees to capitalize on these tools. 

Autodesk also works to maximize remote collaboration at our major events, reducing the effects of travel. In 2009, we added a virtual component to our largest conference, Autodesk University. This allowed more people around the world to access the conference remotely. Read more about our efforts to green our events.

Autodesk has developed sustainability guidelines and best practices for planning an event that requires travel. These guide our staff in evaluating alternatives and making decisions that will reduce the event’s environmental impact. Issues include: 
Selecting a venue that demonstrates sustainable practices 
Choosing a location that minimizes travel distance 
Adding virtual conferencing and online streaming content to maximize the number of attendees who can participate remotely 
Reusing and reducing materials and seeking out materials that are eco-friendly 
Reducing waste throughout the process, from registration to signage and onsite waste reduction 
Implementing onsite recycling 
Conducting an environmental footprint of major events in collaboration with vendors to track progress 
We are especially proud of the following key accomplishments from 2009: 
Booth Design and Reuse
For custom booth development, we effectively reused more than 50% of the previous year’s booth materials. We intend to expand on this achievement again this year, with reuse of nearly 75%. 
Eco-Friendly Materials
We increased the percentage of recyclable or biodegradable event materials in our custom booths to 75%. 
Reducing Travel
For the first time, we added a virtual attendance option at our largest annual conference, Autodesk University (AU). This allowed more people around the world to access the event, while reducing physical attendance. Reducing travel significantly lowers the carbon impact of our events; approximately 80% of our events-related emissions are due to air travel. In 2009, overall attendance at AU—including virtual attendance and other online elements—increased by 95% while carbon emissions decreased by 37%.
 
The Autodesk Events Project Team manages the evaluation, prioritization, and implementation of measures that reduce the environmental impact of our events. The team works in collaboration with key stakeholders across the company."
"Autodesk, Inc.",USA,Public,S&P 500,,Long,"To decrease energy use in our data centers, Autodesk uses the Energy Star rating system to select the most efficient data servers, as well as invests in virtualizing servers. Data server virtualization saves energy by reducing the need to run and cool physical servers. So far, Autodesk has virtualized 38% of our servers. Autodesk is a member of The Green Grid, a global consortium of IT companies seeking to improve energy efficiency in business computing systems. In 2009, we contributed to The Greed Grid Technical Committee’s efforts to develop a metric for data center energy efficiency called Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). The Autodesk average PUE at our main vendor’s data center is 1.8.
Autodesk also works to reduce energy consumption from IT office equipment. Autodesk uses the EPEAT rating system to evaluate, compare, and select desktop hardware based on environmental performance criteria such as energy efficiency, lower use of toxic material, and less waste produced in manufacturing. For example, we have implemented a desktop energy management system that can remotely measure and activate energy efficient power management settings on company-owned computers.
At the end-of-life phase, Autodesk works with electronic waste (e-waste) service providers to replace and recycle our IT equipment responsibly. We evaluate the practices of our e-waste providers and are implementing a policy to screen and prioritize providers according to their environmental performance.
While IT uses energy and generates e-waste, it also offers solutions that help reduce our overall environmental impact. Autodesk has made significant investments in virtual collaboration technologies that will reduce travel and improve remote work. These include 18 Telepresence systems and more than 50 Roundtable systems. In addition, our new standard-issue laptop has a camera integrated into the unit to enhance remote collaboration such as virtual meetings and instant messaging. We are also rolling out training and support programs to encourage employees to use these tools.
The Autodesk IT Project Team manages the evaluation, prioritization, and implementation of measures that reduce the environmental impact of our IT operations. The team works in collaboration with key stakeholders from across the company."

KB Home,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,"1.  Improving energy efficiency of the homes we build: This is a high priority for KB Home, both because of its direct link to climate change (85% of the energy consumed during the entire life cycle of a home comes from day-to-day living), and its ability to reduce the cost of homeownership through the potential reduction in utility bills.  
In 2009, 62% of the homes we built were ENERGY STAR-qualified.  From 2000 through 2009, we built over 64,000 highly energy-efficient homes (ENERGY STAR-qualified homes and ComfortWise certified homes).  According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, each ENERGY STAR-qualified home, when compared to a home built to standard building and energy codes, consumes 15% less energy and reduces GHG emissions by 2.6 metric tons annually.  Accordingly, these homes, in the aggregate, reduce GHG emissions by more than 168,000 metric tons annually when compared to homes built to standard building and energy codes."
KB Home,USA,Public,Other responding corporations,,Long,"2.  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions of our operations:  Among other steps, we have undertaken the following activities: 
 
•	Optimizing Jobsite Construction Scheduling.  We have enhanced our centralized scheduling process to better coordinate the work of third party suppliers and trade labor partners and reduce required travel to and from our jobsites. 

•	Reducing Business-Related Travel.  We have significantly limited the number of in-person company meetings in an effort to reduce the cost of travel, lodging and event expenditures, and to reduce our use of fossil fuel for transporting employees to meetings.  We use a virtual meeting system, branded “KBU iLab.” This in-house technology platform allows all departments and work groups to hold virtual meetings in several online rooms simultaneously, and greatly decreases our travel to meetings and training sessions. In 2009, nearly 2,000 hours of meetings were hosted on KBU iLab. 

•	Eliminating Bottled Water.  In 2008, we eliminated company purchases of bottled water and distributed reusable, water bottles to our employees.  We estimate (based on United States Environmental Protection Agency data) that this change in our corporate headquarters alone reduced our carbon footprint by approximately 5.8 metric tons of CO2 annually.  In 2009, over 80% of our offices implemented this standard.

•	Unplugging Display Refrigerators.  Historically, we have displayed in our model homes and KB Home Studios refrigerators that have been plugged in and are operating even though they are not used for food storage.  We now keep display refrigerators and water heaters unplugged.  In addition, refrigerators displayed in our KB Home Studios have their cooling features turned off.  We estimate that unplugging the display refrigerators alone will reduce our annual energy consumption by 297,550 kWh (per the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Residential Refrigerator Savings Calculator for ENERGY STAR-qualified refrigerators), which is equivalent to reducing our carbon footprint by over 200 metric tons of CO2.

•	Sharing Printers.  Based on a recent computer hardware inventory, we have adopted a goal of removing approximately 50% of our desktop printers from our office environments in 2009."

We planned installation of a tri-generation system at our major data centre which enables us to simultaneously produce electricity, heating and cooling using a gas-fired generator. At our smaller data centre, we have upgraded the conventional UPS to a highly efficient model significantly reducing the energy lost between the input and output. In addition, we are undertaking a server virtualisation program to reduce the overall number of servers required, which reduces the cooling requirements, again reducing our energy demand."

Nippon Telegraph & Telephone (NTT),Japan,Public,Japan 500,Global 500; FTSE All-World 800,Long,"Over 90% of the NTT Group’s CO2 emissions are attributable to electrical power consumption by offi ces and communications equipment. To reduce our demand for electrical power, we are implementing a groupwide Total Power Revolution (TPR) campaign. Through this campaign, we have been promoting energy management schemes for the 4,000 buildings that our various companies occupy throughout Japan. In addition to deploying energy efficient electrical devices and air conditioning equipment and switching to the use of energy-saving DC power supply* for broadband equipment such as servers and routers, the TPR campaign also calls for the use of clean energy systems such as solar and wind power. These various initiatives resulted in a saving of 150 million kWh of electricity throughout the entire NTT Group in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. We have also launched a Green NTT initiative for promoting the use of renewable energy such as solar power, and we plan to deploy the equivalent of 5 megawatts of solar power systems by fi scal 2013 under a limited liability partnership called NTT-Green LLP.
